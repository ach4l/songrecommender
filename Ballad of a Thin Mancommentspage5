				<strong class="title">General Comment</strong>I think in the rush to discover the "hidden" meaning of this song, people are looking past some of the more obvious stuff. While there do seem to be some lyrics alluding to homosexuality, there are whole sections of the song that have nothing to do with this. Plus, the hostility displayed towards Mr. Jones would hardly indicate a sympathetic commentary on homosexuality. I find the hostile tone more consistent with the critical character assassination of Like a Rolling Stone and much of the Highway 61 album.<br />
<br />
The meaning is closer to what people were saying about criticism of the establishment. I've always thought of it as having a bit of a generational meaning as well. F Scott Fitzgerald was popular primarily in the 20's - a generation or two before Dylan's. The youngest people to have read Fitzgerald in the 20's would have been about 60 when this song was released. Add this to all the contacts, professors, charities, great lawyers, etc that Mr. Jones consorts with, and it suggests that he's an older, educated, upper class individual who, despite all his knowledge and power, can't comprehend the changes happening in society in the 1960's - namely the youth 'counter-culture.'<br />
<br />
I suspect that the nonsensical verses are deliberately designed to confuse us and thus put us in Mr. Jones' shoes, and little more. You have to be careful not to read TOO much into lyrics sometimes, especially Dylan's. Not every line has an explicit and carefully constructed meaning. He used to write songs like this in about 15 minutes.

" The GREAT GATSBY" is considered an American classic and was assigned reading when I was in high school in the early 70's. It is partly about the corruption of materialism and undo status. But I do think you are right, that some of the lyrics are surrealistic and in some ways meaningless, which allows each of us to impart our own meaning. That is the geinious of Dylan.			<div class="sign">

			If this song is going to be a veiled attack on anyone surnamed Jones, it would probably be Brian Jones from the rolling stones. Bob and Brian were close friends, especially around this time. Actually, in Bill Wyman's book it states that Brian (a notoriously paranoid man) was afraid that the song was about him. Dylan even said once that he wrote "Like a Rolling Stone" for Brian, so it seems pretty plausible. And given Brian's nature, the lyrics don't seem like a very far stretch to describe Brian.			<div class="sign">

				<strong class="title">General Comment</strong>Until I came here I didn't (and still don't) think there was much doubt about what, in a general sense, the song is about.  It is a satire against all the pompous critics and journalists who were constantly asking what Dylan's songs were about, but didn't have a clue about the creative process.  Whether there was some particular writer who got on Dylan's nerves, and if so whether that writer was called Jones, is almost irrelevant.

			True! Originally, this song was about the pompous critics and journalists who don't have a clue about the creative process. Bob Dylan has always said that. Mr Jones is one of these conformist journalists who is confronted to a freakin world and doesn't know what's happening. I really love the chorus "something is happening here but you don't know what it is. Do you, Mr Jones?" with a very worrying tone. It's about losing control and about how these conformist people always want to have control over things, other people and minds. <br />
But I'm very curious about the "homosexuality theory". How could Dylan write such obvious images unintentionally? th sword swallower, the milk, even "with your pencil in your hand", can be interpreted as sexual scenes. And it makes sense with "there ought to be a law against you comin around". That's what a lot of conformist people think about homosexuality. Maybe, Dylan is just killing two birds with one stone!			<div class="sign">

				<strong class="title">General Comment</strong>Although the song can be interpreted in many ways, I concur with harperfan7 and see it as a story about a man discovering his homosexualiy- "there is something happening here, but you don't know what it is". The circus/freak show is a metaphor for how society saw/sees the homosexual community. The sword swallower line is the most obvious reference in my opinion

				<strong class="title">Song Meaning</strong>Yeah, could be about homosexually...it's about many things but i strongly interpret it as a record producer called, Mr Jones. A guy with no esthetical values, a seller of the soul attacking peoples imagination, using their throats to financially benefit. Mr Jones is lost in this world of creativity and blinded by money, he doesn't understand the true meaning of art. Something is happening and he just doesn't know what it is.

				<strong class="title">My Interpretation</strong>I have an interpretation of this song which makes much more sense ,IMO, than some of the ones that were presented here.<br />
This is based on dylanâs life, a complement to âlike a rolling stoneâ you may say.<br />
Itâs about discovering the true face of society, oppressive and blind.<br />
Itâs a very simple analysis, but as you know, sometimes itâs the simplest thing which is right. I will add some more thing later.<br />
Letâs start.<br />
<br />
You walk into the room  <br />
With your pencil in your hand<br />
You see somebody naked <br />
And you say, "Who is that man?"<br />
You try so hard <br />
But you don't understand<br />
Just what you'll say <br />
When you get home <br />
	You are starting to know what society is like, entering the room represents the very beginning of it. You see things that you just donât understand.<br />
 <br />
Because something is happening here <br />
But you don't know what it is <br />
Do you, Mister Jones <br />
	You know something is happening, but canât comprehend it.<br />
<br />
You raise up your head <br />
And you ask, "Is this where it is?" <br />
And somebody points to you and says <br />
"It's his" <br />
And you say, "What's mine?" <br />
And somebody else says, "Where what is?" <br />
And you say, "Oh my God <br />
Am I here all alone?" <br />
	You decide to stand up for what you think is right. You raise up your head. But then you discover you are alone, nobody listen to you.<br />
<br />
Because something is happening here <br />
But you don't know what it is <br />
Do you, Mister Jones <br />
<br />
You hand in your ticket <br />
And you go watch the geek <br />
Who immediately walks up to you<br />
When he hears you speak <br />
And says, "How does it feel <br />
To be such a freak?" <br />
And you say, "Impossible"<br />
As he hands you a bone <br />
	Now they are undermining you, you are being made fun of, you are the fool now. That âfreakâ you used to laugh about is now you.<br />
<br />
Because something is happening here<br />
But you don't know what it is <br />
Do you, Mister Jones <br />
<br />
You have many contacts <br />
Among the lumberjacks <br />
To get you facts <br />
When somebody attacks your imagination <br />
But nobody has any respect <br />
Anyway they already expect you <br />
To just give a check <br />
To tax-deductible charity organizations <br />
	 <br />
You've been with the professors <br />
And they've all liked your looks <br />
With great lawyers you have <br />
Discussed lepers and crooks <br />
You've been through all of <br />
F. Scott Fitzgerald's books <br />
You're very well read <br />
It's well known <br />
     You have lots of ideas, thoughts, you are smart, but the world just donât give a damm about you. They all expect you to make up to your part in society, to give a check to tax deductible charity organizations.<br />
<br />
Because something is happening here <br />
But you don't know what it is <br />
Do you, Mister Jones <br />
<br />
Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you <br />
And then he kneels <br />
He crosses himself <br />
And then he clicks his high heels <br />
And without further notice <br />
He asks you how it feels <br />
And he says, "Here is your throat back <br />
Thanks for the loan" <br />
	Now this is a very clear reference to dylanâs history. The sword swallower fools you, pretend he is your friend and then without further notice he clicks his high heels (change sides, reveal himself). And he used your throat to do his dirty job and now it is destroyed by the sword. It's dylan's reject of the folk movement.<br />
<br />
Because something is happening here <br />
But you don't know what it is <br />
Do you, Mister Jones <br />
<br />
Now you see this one-eyed midget <br />
Shouting the word "NOW" <br />
And you say, "For what reason?" <br />
And he says, "How?" <br />
And you say, "What does this mean?" <br />
And he screams back, "You're a cow <br />
Give me some milk <br />
Or else go home" <br />
	Now you see this guy, who is, literally, âlowerâ than you and donât see very well. And he gives you orders, you are his âcowâ. This is society, this is that guy who owns you even though you are much smarter and sees thing much better than him.<br />
<br />
Because something is happening here <br />
But you don't know what it is <br />
Do you, Mister Jones <br />
<br />
Well, you walk into the room<br />
Like a camel and then you frown <br />
You put your eyes in your pocket <br />
And your nose to the ground <br />
There ought to be a law <br />
Against you comin' around <br />
You should be made <br />
To wear earphones <br />
	And there is just one thing left to do, you pretend you donât see anything (eyes in your pockets). You stop standing up for what you think is right (put your nose on the ground). You really shouldnât be made to think for yourself, you should be made to follow societyâs order rigorously.<br />
<br />
Well this is basically it, very simple interpretation as i said. But i think it makes sense, don't it?<br />

				<strong class="title">Song Meaning</strong>This song was NOT written about homosexuality! Dylan says it himself:<br />
<br />
"He's a pinboy. He also wears suspenders. He's a real person. You know him, but not by that name... I saw him come into the room one night and he looked like a camel. He proceeded to put his eyes in his pocket. I asked this guy who he was and he said, "That's Mr. Jones." Then I asked this cat, "Doesn't he do anything but put his eyes in his pocket?" And he told me, "He puts his nose on the ground." It's all there, it's a true story."<br />
