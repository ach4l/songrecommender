				<strong class="title">My Interpretation</strong>One of the first noticeable steps into Dylan's electric instability is the first song off his first '65 album Bringing It All Back Home, âSubterranean Homesick Bluesâ. This album was about when Dylan's stability began to deteriorate. He began to walk away from the solo-acoustic-folk direction and bought a nice loud amp that his new makeshift band could hear him bang his guitar through. Subterranean Homesick Blues is sort of a protest song, but more of a warning to the youth about the corruption of the government and how they basically screw the youth over, and he's telling them that regardless of what the government says, you should live freely.<br />
<br />
	The song starts out with an average Johnny, âin the basement mixing up the medicineâ, meaning he's making booze (which is commonly referred to as âgrandpa's cough medicineâ) in the basement, which an average Johnny has the ability to make, while Dylan's âon the pavement thinking about the government.â Dylan is out on the street with the rest of the young generation as he begins his loud rant about the government's corruption. He talks about âThe man in the trench coatâ, an off duty cop, with his âbadge out, laid offâ, coming up to his door, who âsays he's got a bad coughâ, wants some âcough medicineâ, and âwants to get it paid offâ, meaning that he wants it free so he's blackmailing them and will arrest them if they don't give it to him. So you better âLook out kid, it's somethin' you did, god knows when, but you're doin' it again.â because even if you didn't really do anything wrong, the cops have the power to get you in trouble. Dylan gives advice that âYou better duck down the alley way, lookin' for a new friendâ, when you're running away from the cops and just try again. He then describes a cop as âThe man in the coon-skin capâ, âIn the big penâ, which is jail, and he âWants eleven dollar billsâ to bail you out of jail when he knows that âyou only got ten.â, but that's just how it is, because the cop can do that. <br />
<br />
	In the second verse, Dylan says, âMaggie comes fleet foot, face full of black soot, talkin' that the heat put plants in the bed butâ, Maggie comes running downstairs where they make their booze saying that the âheatâ (cops) planted microphones in the bedrooms, which was a common practice for drug busts in the 60's. In the next lines, âThe phone's tapped anyway, Maggie says that many say, they must bust in early May, orders from the D. A.â Maggie says that she's heard some of the underground warnings that busts have been ordered in early May by the District Attorney. âWalk on your tip toes, don't try 'No Doz'â, be careful with what you do. Then Dylan warns to âBetter stay away from those, that carry around a fire hoseâ, which are the riot police, and âKeep a clean nose, watch the plain clothesâ, which are undercover cops, and âYou don't need a weather man to know which way the wind blows.â, meaning that you don't need a random person to tell you what's going on with the world and what to believe when you can figure it out for yourself. <br />
<br />
	âGet sickâ, when your drug supply is dry, then âget wellâ when they come back around, âhang around a ink wellâ is hanging out with other junkies. âRing bellâ, like a service bell at a store, âhard to tell if anything is goin' to sellâ, it's really tough to make it as a drug dealer. âTry hardâ and put in a lot of effort as a dealer, âget barredâ, get busted for dealing. Then you âGet back, write braille, get jailed, jump bail, join the army, if you fail.â, meaning that you should try something new, writing braille is a term for being really drunk, try to do something with your life, and if all else fails, join the army. The next lines, âBut users, cheaters, six-time losers, hang around the theaters, girl by the whirlpool, lookin' for a new fool.â, are about drug users and dealers, pimps, and prostitutes that hang out around theaters at night, particularly 42nd street (a street in Manhattan referenced in multiple songs by Dylan which in the 60's to the late 80's was well known for it's low class, ghetto inhibitors). The last line of the verse, âDon't follow leaders, watch the parkin' meters.â, says that instead of worrying about other people so much, you should worry about your own problems, like when your parking meter runs out of time. This verse sums up the life of a person living living in the underground, in a life of drugs, jail, and prostitutes, in complete contrast with the final verse.<br />
<br />
	The next lines, âAh get born, keep warm, short pants, romance, learn to dance, get dressed, get blessed, try to be a success, please her, please him, buy gifts, don't steal, don't lift, twenty years of schoolin', and they put you on the day shift.â, talk about how if you don't live your life (relatively) like the previous verse, you work hard your whole life trying to be a success just to look forward to a boring, average job. âLook out kid, they keep it all hidâ - a fair warning to the youth to watch out for the corrupt government. Dylan suggests that you âBetter jump down a manhole, light yourself a candle, don't wear sandals, try to avoid the scandals, don't wanna be a bum, you better chew gumâ and get yourself away from the corrupt society, and to stay low and keep off of the cops' radar. In the last line of the song, Dylan says that âThe pump don't work 'cause the vandals took the handles.â In the 60's and 70's, one of many common ways that people would warn others about upcoming drug raids was by stealing the handles off gas pumps.

				<strong class="title">General Comment</strong>Definitely about the Beats. The title is an allusion to "The Subterraneans", a novel by Jack Kerouac. It's certainly stream of consciousness, and a lot of it is just playing around with the way words sound, but that doesn't mean it's meaningless.     <br />
The first two verses seem to tell a story about drug dealers, particularly their interactions with the cops. "Look out kid, it's something you did/God knows when but your doing it again" probably refers to the original sin. He refers to two of his own songs here: "Blowing in the Wind" ("Don't need a weatherman to know which way the wind blow") and Maggie's Farm ("Maggie comes ..."). "Better stay away from those that carry around a fire hose" probably alludes to the Montgomery Riots, where fire hoses where turned on protesters.<br />
The third and fourth verses are, essentially, do it yourself guides for the counterculture and mainstream. Both are fairly nightmarish, to be honest. The former basically instructs on how to stay alive in the counterculture, while especially focused on the leaches and jerks that any such culture inevitably accrues. "Girl by the whirlpool" may be an allusion to the sirens from the Odyssey (Whirlpool = Charybdis), but that seems to be stretching it a bit. The latter is a run-down of the indignities            inherent to the capitalist society we live in ("Try and be a success", "Buy gifts", "Don't want to be a bum you better chew gum"), and a warning to stay away from the counter culture ("Don't where sandals, try and avoid scandals")

				<strong class="title">General Comment</strong>The first two verses are a story.<br />
<br />
Johnny's in the basement mixing up the medicine - Johnny's brewing booze. This is probably during the prohibition, but it also parallels cooking LSD or acid in the basement in later generations. It's same as it ever was, so the images here are transcendent of ongoing societal phenomena.<br />
<br />
I'm on the pavement thinking about the government - Literal, but also just painting a picture of Dylan trying to make sense of things.<br />
<br />
the man in the trench coat, badge out, laid off,<br />
says he's got a bad cough, wants to get it paid off. - He wants some cough medicine, aka he's looking for some booze.<br />
<br />
Look out kid, it's something you did, God knows when, but you're doing it again. - The kid is presumed guilty. Even if he hasn't done anything wrong before, he's doing it "again", and he's destined to do it again because society assumes he's the kind who would do it. Amazing line.<br />
<br />
You better duck down the alley way, looking for a new friend, - Run away from the cops, try again.<br />
<br />
the man in the coon-skip cap in the big pen wants eleven dollar bills, you only got ten. - The man in the coon-skin cap is a bounty hunter, or a cop, the big pen is jail, to get out he wants eleven dollar bills, just one more than you've got, and that's the way it's always going to be: why not ten bills? Because it's better to torture you with not making it by just THAT much.<br />
<br />
<br />
So so far we've had an image of the lower class: brewing booze in the basement, assumed criminals who are destined to end up in jail, and the people with the keys set bail a dollar higher than you could pay. It's just a basic critique of society.<br />
<br />
<br />
Maggie comes fleet foot, face full of black soot, - Black soot could be some sort of drug, but basically this is just a metaphor that Maggie's running into the apartment, the underground, in quite a haste.<br />
<br />
talking that the heat put, plants in the bed but<br />
the phone's tapped anyway, Maggie says that many say<br />
they must bust in early May, orders from the DA. - Maggie warns everyone that "the heat" (the cops, the fbi, cia, whatever) put mics in their house. But her warnings don't matter, because the phone is tapped anyways. She says word on the street is that they'll be a drug bust in early may, ordered by the District Attorney's office.<br />
<br />
Look out kid, don't matter what you did. Walk on your tiptoes, don't try 'No Doz.' - Be careful, don't get caught, NoDoz is a caffeine pill.<br />
<br />
Better stay away from those that carry around a fire hose, - Watch out for the riot police.<br />
<br />
keep a clean nose, watch the plain clothes, - The "plain clothes" are undercover cops. "Keeping a clean nose" is not looking suspicious.<br />
<br />
you don't need a weather man to know which way the wind blows. - The Weathermen (Chicago terrorists) took their name from this line. "The way wind blows" is what's going on, what's coming down, what's happening on the street. You don't need a weatherman to figure it out, it's just street smarts.<br />
<br />
The next to verses are starkly contrasted one with the other:<br />
<br />
Get sick, get well, hang around an ink well.<br />
Ring bell, hard to tell if anything is going to sell,<br />
try hard, get barred, get back, write Braille,<br />
get jailed, jump bail, join the army if you failed.<br />
Look out kid, you're gonna get hit, but users, cheaters, <br />
six-time losers hang around the theaters.<br />
Girl by the whirlpool looking for a new fool, <br />
don't follow leaders, watch the parking meters.<br />
<br />
That verse is about someone living in the underground. Using drugs, getting arrested, going in and out of jail, out with the whores and the drug dealers, just getting by.<br />
<br />
The next verse is meant to contrast the preceding verse:<br />
<br />
Ah get born, keep warm, short pants, romance, learn to dance,<br />
get dressed, get blessed, try to be a success,<br />
please her, please him, buy gifts, don't steal, don't lift,<br />
twenty years of schooling and they put you on the day shift.<br />
Look out kid, they keep it all hid.<br />
Better jump down a manhole, light yourself a candle.<br />
Don't wear sandals, try to avoid the scandals.<br />

Basically this verse just shows that trying to live successfully, clean, is really no different. It's just as crazy and back-and-forth and pointless and full of despair.

				<strong class="title">General Comment</strong>Ok I completeley agree with  "yamahasixstring" and the moonshine theory. Johnnie is in the the basement making booze, which is commonly refered to as "grandpas cough medicine".  then an off duty cop comes down who is in need for his cough medicine, but wants it free, like payin' him off for not arresting him. although I think this is a metaphor for cooking drugs during the sixties. <br />
just like everyone who has commented, I believe is a rant about what society tells youth to do, to follow a straight path. Yet the kids don't. follow this path they.  they do things like take amphetemines, wear sandals, protest, blah blah.

				<strong class="title">General Comment</strong>The Rover is right of course. I was surprised to see so many people who assume the song is nonsense. All the lines have quite specific meanings and they're all about life in the underground, ie counterculture, bohemian lifestyle in the 60s.  A lot of it is drug stuff - even such nonsensical sounding lines as "Get sick, get well, hang around an ink well". That refers to getting "dope sick" when the heroin runs out, and then "getting well" means getting high again when the heroin shows up. Hang around the inkwell means hang out with the other bohemian writer types - like a writers cafe or even a bar that was literally called 'The inkwell"...

				<strong class="title">General Comment</strong>i think this song is simply about a guy whos selling drugs and ends up dealin with a cop who is obviously ripping him off and threatning him with arrest or something, and plants in the bed is obviously about the cops planting listining devices in the dealers house and the police are planning a bust in early may, dont try no doz is probably a reference that they are selling amphetemines and not to look suspicious by takin them, and then i think he is caught put in jail rehab and then goes on trying to lead a normal life (last 2 stanzas) law obiding and a 9-5 job but he doesnt like the job but does it anyway (try to be a success,<br />
please her, please him, buy gifts, don't steal, don't lift,<br />
twenty years of schooling and they put you on the day shift.)<br />
then theres the irony that hes living this straight life and has 2 deal with crime and stuff around him (try to avoid the scandals.<br />
Don't wanna be a bum, you better chew gum.<br />
The pump don't work cause the vandals took the handles) well thats my 2 cents worth of rabbling anyway
