				<strong class="title">My Interpretation</strong>I think it is about Jesus and his crucifixion at first. Him, the joker, and the Thief, his crucified company. Christ is talking about how everyone's lost their way and nobody cares, drinking his blood for pleasure, and ruining his earth for their needs, without knowing where any of it came from and not caring otherwise. The thief, crucified with Christ, knows the worth of these things, and tells hims that you can't really do nothing to make these other people change how they think and value these things, because they are the criminals, and will be executed soon.<br />
<br />
I think the watchtower part is the history of men. The leaders, or princes, could even be replaced with men as the prejudice is that men are the leaders of humankind, kept the same view as the businessmen and plowmen and what not, believing everything Christ said was a joke and nothing holds value, while women and servants, which I think are supposed to mean just about everyone else who doesn't have any authority amongst the direction of the human race, along history some of them believe in what the Joker and the Thief were talking about, but not enough to save the world from the wildcat, or the "Evil" or maybe "Judgement" that was coming. And the Death, followed by Hades on horseback from Revelation 6:8 is a good interpretation of who the two horse riders could be.

				<strong class="title">General Comment</strong>Just like most Dylan songs, the layers of meaning in this song are constructed with just enough of a reference to current political and philisophical movements, and just enough of a reference to emotionally charged images and stories from our collective history (including the Bible), that it allows for different interpretations based on the projections of meanings by the individual listener.  There is no one "right" meaning.<br />
That being said, there IS a specific theme.  The song describes the moment before the crash of modern values that give the rich power.  The Joker and the Thief know what is going on, they are symbols of the change in power, the least will be first.  The women and servents seemed confused about what side to be on and how to prepare.  The princes are ignorant of any danger.  The riders on the horses are certainly bringing on "a storm" of death.  The wind "howling" could be a reference to the poem "howl" that inspired the beat generation to embrace the existential truths of authentic living, or just a nice metephor for how the noise of the chaos will drown out everything else (a point that Jimi's version seems to emphasize).<br />
The Joker and the Thief are both trickster archetypes, wise souls that are not recognized as such by the unenlightened.  It is easy to link Jesus to this archetype, for he was not recognized as the messiah even by the very people he was sent to save.  Also, he always spoke in parables (jokes), "so that those who have ears will hear" and was crucified next to a thief.  The riders on the horses also seems to touch on the apocolypic meaning in the bible.

				<strong class="title">Song Meaning</strong>Dylan was writing this song when there was a great awakening in humanity about who controlled the governments and wars- the real social order. Much like today there were ever expanding wars- clashes between police and the public, civil unrest, and fraud in the federal reserve and IRS. In fact many were awakening to the fact that the whole system of commerce and the military industrial complex is a complete fraud. The song is as follows:<br />
The Joker, a.k.a politician, false power representative/ obama/bush/nixon/carter, etc. was getting concerned at the growing unrest and anger of the public, the joker/politicians busy distracting people- putting on a public face knows that the people are getting restless. He has been able to perpetuate the lie of social order by allowing businessmen corrupt access, and they are intoxicated with the illusion of wealth, and the plowman is also fooled by this political game- <br />
he gladly tills the earth (labors) for "wealth" which is phony (like a federal reserve note) neither the worker nor businessman question where the actual wealth is going. The theif (the actual ruler of society a.k.a rockefeller/ rothschild, etc. ) want to perpetuate the fraud and encourage the politician(joker) that the public cannot understand what is actually going on. They beleive the joke played on them. The Theif reminds the joker that they know the truth about<br />
what is going on and the the fraud game will eventually end- the hour is getting late. The watchtower symbolizes the elite's towering observation over the commoners and the princes (princes of theivery-ruling class) keep their high position in society looking down on everybody else, exploiting numerous women, and servants, keeping them barefoot and maintaining their dominance over them. The wildcat (the growing resentment of the public as they awakeing to the fraud) begins<br />
to stir, and the growl (talk) of revolution is at hand. the two rider approaching symbolically form the four riders of Apocalypse, the white rider (as the righteous coming towards the tower) the red horse (the coming war) over the black horse (famine/the theif of life/theif of wealth) and finally the pale horse (death)

				<strong class="title">General Comment</strong>Quite honestly, no one can know the mind of Dylan but Dylan, though I do love the commentary on what these wonderful lyrics COULD mean. One of my favorite conversations I have had with friends about this song was one I had with a friend of mine who is a Jehovah's Witness. I was surprised to hear the possibility that Dylan had studied with the witnesses for a time in the late seventies before he converted to another denomination. And though many of his songs had biblical references prior to, it was surrounding the time he studied with them that his interest in the end times was heightened. I have heard much of this song's references to government and war, which is exactly what the end times of the Bible encompass.<br />
<br />
He expounded as follows:<br />
<br />
The Joker might refer to 'the foolish man' in Matthew who does so well in his business that he chooses to expand without consideration for his spirituality. The account ends with God warning him that others are after his soul. Who then will have the things he stored up?<br />
<br />
God also likens himself to "a thief" who comes in "the night", that is unseen and arrives when least expected --warning those with faith that they should keep awake spiritually and be ready for their Master.<br />
<br />
When the song begins, the Joker is looking for a way out --for refuge from those after his soul. The Businessmen, or merchants, mentioned in revelation, get rich off the existence of false religion in league with worldly government, something the Joker himself depends on for his business, which if you remember was 'expanding' according to Matthew.<br />
<br />
"Too much confusion" comes from the struggle for a spiritual man to stay balanced between spiritual things and those necessary for making a living, relief coming only when you rely wholly on God and not your own devices for your daily needs --not the Joker's strong suit, as he is too preoccupied with the value of his expanding harvest, something that common folk (the Plowmen) are not interested in, as they keep their eyes fixed on basic needs --not profits.<br />
<br />
"No reason to get excited" translates to Jesus' instruction not to be anxious over anything and that the soul and body mean more than food and clothing. The Thief's speaking kindly is God expressing his desire that no one be destroyed but that all should repent and make necessary changes to avoid being caught unprepared when He comes, though He acknowledges that most will not because "many feel that life (everlasting) is but a joke."<br />
<br />
The fact that the Thief says "we've been through all that" suggests that God has been with the Joker and has not given up on him despite being foolish as of late, but that there is much of value in him worth saving if he would only make the sound decision to put away his worldly, valueless things --while there is yet time. This would mean his pursuing the Truth without delay, requiring him to "not talk falsely now, [because] the hour is getting late."<br />
<br />
All along, the Watchtower from the book of Ezekiel has been the chosen symbol the Jehovah's Witnesses used as the title of their magazines, through which they pass on the Bible's announcing God's coming as a thief. Fittingly so, because "princes" has been used throughout the Bible as a reference to angels who reveal to men God's warnings. <br />
<br />
Women coming and going is from the the parable of the Ten Virgins mentioned in Matthew, some of whom are ready for the Groom's arrival, and some of whom did not adequately prepare for him (again alluding to the Joker --the foolish man who is in the same position.) "Barefoot servants" is the exact definition of the word 'minister' according to many biblical reference works. These correlate to Servants of God, some of whom, like the Virgins, are faithful and discreet, ready for the Thief, while others are wicked slaves, or hypocrites, according to Matthew.<br />
<br />
The wild cat in the cold distance is nearly a word for word description of Satan and his place of dwelling (who walks about like a roaring lion) in the cold distance (the darkness outside) where those who are weeping and gnashing their teeth figuratively dwell. The two riders can be many different things, any of which fit appropriately... A reference to the "two witnesses" of revelation, or perhaps half of the horsemen who preclude the end: the first two of which to ride, according to my friend, is Jesus on the white horse, and of course War, a sign of the coming end, which Jesus said in Matthew NOT to be terrified of (no reason to get excited :)<br />
<br />
At last, the wind howling is perhaps the four winds that the angels in revelation are holding back while God permits time for faithful ones to repent, one of which, again, is the foolish man, the Joker, who has not yet done so... but still has time.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
I felt my friend's thoughts were quite compelling, coupled with the many others I have seen online about this song. Truly, I never was exposed to these lyrics until I heard Dave Matthew's version, which gave way to the discussion I just broke down for you above. Several of us get together and pull apart lyrics to songs with biblical tie-ins. Perhaps our thoughts are dead on, and perhaps not. But it is obvious, regardless of interpretation, that Dylan and other musicians have brought their knowledge of Scripture and their talent together on countless occasions to touch on spiritual thoughts for the benefit of their listeners, reeling us in and inspiring conversations to take place about God, the Bible, and all the things that Christians everywhere ought to keep considering with one another...<br />

				<strong class="title">General Comment</strong>First but much less importantly, on origins. I'm going to state what I am relatively certain the origins are because there's a lot of discussion on it here, but it's important to know that you do not need to understand any origin to understand the song. In fact, any preconceptions are detrimental. So forget my opinion after you've read it, until after you read the rest of this comment and the song. At that point you should have more interesting things to think about, but if you don't, knock yourself out with the origins.<br />
<br />
Belteshazzar is right that the origins are the parable of the tenants. Watchtower is in the title and the first line of the parable, and drinking my wine, digging my earth, which the tenants do, are found in the song. Dylan had started reading the Bible at this time. I'll be giving too much away here if you've read and understood the parable, but they have the same focus (Dylan broadens the lens, and it is safe to say Jesus meant the same larger applications to be seen by implication), and many, if not all, of the meanings overlap. Once you've read how to read Dylan's Watchtower below, and have read it a few times without catching the meaning, you could read the parable as a spoiler. Don't unless you have to, though, again. Better to read my hint first than the parable, so you can extract the meaning from the song.<br />
<br />
Another thing on origins, Jesus does not equal the joker just because his picture's on a tarot card. Dylan's more meaningful than that. Once you've understood the meaning you will see the reason that Jesus could not be the joker, his crucifixion's thief cannot be Dylan's thief. Although I haven't definitively overruled it yet, since there's no real reason to jump to conclusions on it, put it aside.<br />
<br />
Put all origin ideas out of your mind. As I said, doesn't matter. I just mentioned it because of the ongoing discussion.<br />
<br />
Watchtower is allegory. A lot (all? not sure) of Dylan is. Allegory is facts with hidden meaning (although "hidden" makes it sound shadier than it is). To understand allegory, momentarily assume the facts as true (although some of these facts are hidden themselves, the proper lens reveals them). By true I mean, assume with Dylan that it's an accurate picture of his subject matter, whatever you believe he's speaking about. Let the conclusions come to you without prejudice, more than seeking them out. So say you think the facts are the joker's confusion and the thief's offered comfort, and that the watchtower is an ominous picture of the mojave desert. Then what you can conclude would be that the place the joker's in just happens to be confusing, the thief desires to comfort the joker, and the mojave desert gets two thumbs down.<br />
<br />
Now, once you're done with this process, you have Dylan's meaning. Now - forget it. Go back and examine the facts. If the facts he gives you on whatever his subject matter is in the song line up with the facts of that same subject matter in our real world, or portions of it, then Dylan's meaning attaches to our world, or portions of it. If this is the case, take the meaning with you. Pour it in a cup.<br />
<br />
Fin. Couple last things.<br />
<br />
A quick aside re: origins before the hint. It's beautiful to read both parable and song, it's like Dylan drew the inverse. He forces you to draw conclusions where Jesus is explicit, and where Jesus' ends it and lets you think bigger on your own, Dylan shows you the wider picture pretty clearly once you've gotten the closeup.<br />
<br />
K.<br />
Here's<br />
your<br />
hint<br />
<br />
-<br />
-<br />
-<br />
Dylan's subject matter is people. Put yourself in the shoes of the joker. The thief. The princes. The women. The servants. What are your motivations? Actions? Types of events that have occurred in the past in your life and your responses to them in order to become what you are?

				<strong class="title">General Comment</strong>first of all, i agree with the jesus thing.<br />
<br />
dylan was the best songwriter ever, however id like to remind everyone because its often overlooked, that he was also the beasstliest harmonica player ever. he really played it like nobody else. he basically substituted it for an electric guitar and soloed the hell out of it. (I saw him in concert recently and whenever he pulled out his harmonica, everyone went insane)

				<strong class="title">Song Meaning</strong>OKAY, HERE IS THE STRAIGHT DOPE!  <br />
<br />
The song is about The Record Industry.  That is why other recording artists always want to record it.  When explained correctly, all artists can identify with this track.  <br />
<br />
The Joker is the Artist--In This Case Bob Dylan<br />
The Thief is his Manager-Agent-Label Contact...etc.--In This Case Albert Grossman (Dylan's manager at the time this song was penned) <br />
<br />
In the first verse, the Joker is going to his confidant and pleading to get him out of his current lot in life.  'Businessmen Drink His Wine, Ploughmen Dig His earth means--but none of them along the line know what any of it is worth' means that the recording artist is unhappy with the standard businessperson's approach towards selling art.  They bottle it like Coca Cola, and it hurts the creative artist.<br />
<br />
Then in the Second verse, the Thief talks the Artist into not thinking about things so deeply (for to remain a Thief (or a leach, really), the Joker must continue to work).  The Theif basically talks the Joker into getting back on Stage or in the Recording Studio or what have you.  The Hour is Getting late means go be a professional and do your job, no matter what you think on a personal level.  <br />
<br />
The last verse is about the decadence of being a Pop Star. Barefoot Servants and all that, it ends with a reflection that someday all this decadence must end. Dylan reflects on this a lot (Slow Train Coming comes to mind).  The 2 Riders are kinda like the horsemen of the coming apocalypse.  And The Wind began to howl...<br />
<br />
Get it?

				<strong class="title">My Interpretation</strong>Though I  have no  knowledge of  the relevant  religions and<br />
their literature I am happy to give my amateur readings...<br />
<br />
I include  Isaiah 20  because Isaiah himself was told by God<br />
to go  about naked  and barefoot,  which he  did. This was a<br />
sign  that  the  Emperor  of  Assyria  will  lead  away  the<br />
prisoners he  captures in  Egypt and  Sudan, they  will walk<br />
barefoot and  naked, bringing  shame on  Egypt. And  that is<br />
what the  chapter Isaiah  is all about, Judah -- the land of<br />
the Jews  -- is  threatened by  Assyria. Isaiah,  an  eighth<br />
century B.C.  prophet, sees  that the  real  threat  is  not<br />
Assyria but  Judah's own sin and disobedience to God, a lack<br />
of trust  in him.  God refers  to Isaiah as his servant, and<br />
the theme  of the  Servant of  the  Lord  is  a  strong  one<br />
throughout. Isaiah  calls us  to a life of righteousness and<br />
justice, warning us that failure to listen to God will bring<br />
certain doom  and destruction. The consequences of rejecting<br />
the Lord  are disaster,  confusion and trouble in everything<br />
we do. (Deuteronomy 28:20)<br />
<br />
You think  maybe Isaiah  influenced Mr  Dylan  at  all?  Any<br />
familiar themes  here? :-)  Anyway Isaiah  20 gets  us  some<br />
"barefoot servants too" wandering about naked.<br />
<br />
In Isaiah 21 we turn to a vision of the fall of Babylon. All<br />
you Bob  Marley fans will know the role of Babylon, the most<br />
beautiful kingdom  of all  which the Lord will destroy as he<br />
did Sodom  and Gomorrah,  making it  a  place  where  desert<br />
animals live.  The people of Judah were in exile in Babylon.<br />
Its towers  will echo  with the cries of hyenas and jackals.<br />
Its disaster  arrives like  a whirlwind  sweeping across the<br />
desert, but  read the  chapter if you want a full picture of<br />
the vision. The vision alone gave as much pain as a woman in<br />
labour experiences,  if you want something to measure it by!<br />
That wind  of destruction  is described  elsewhere too,  for<br />
example in  Jeremiah  51:1.  And  the  fall  of  Babylon  in<br />
Revelation 18  mentions the  strong wine  of  immoral  lust,<br />
sexual immorality, and businessmen of the world growing rich<br />
from unrestrained  lust... "While  all the  women  came  and<br />
went."<br />
<br />
An illustration  also given in Isaiah 13 is a description of<br />
the howling  in pain when the Lord's destruction arrives. In<br />
Isaiah 14  where God destroys the Philistines, they too howl<br />
and cry  for help.  In Isaiah  16 we hear the howling of the<br />
people of  the land  of Moab  in its  hopeless situation. In<br />
Isaiah 23  we have  sailors  who  howl  with  grief  at  the<br />
destruction of  Tyre. It is God's doing and he did it to put<br />
an end  to their  pride. It  was the Baylonians who were his<br />
instrument here,  and they devastated it so much that it was<br />
overrun by  wild animals.  We also  find the  princes  here,<br />
namely merchant  princes of Tyre, and we are talking serious<br />
mercantile wealth, the ancient equivalent of Sony main board<br />
directors. And  earlier we had the princes of Zoan in Isaiah<br />
19, where  God  punishing  Egypt  is  described,  and  those<br />
princes are fools. And the princes of Jerusalem, the city of<br />
sin in Isaiah 1, they are friends of thieves, taking bribes,<br />
turning from  orphans,  ignoring  the  plight  of  widows...<br />
"Princes kept the view."<br />
<br />
Note also  the poor forgotten prostitute in this section who<br />
plays a  harp and sings. By Isaiah 24 there is no more happy<br />
singing over  wine, no one enjoys its taste any more, people<br />
shout in  the streets  because there is no wine. In the city<br />
everything is  in chaos,  there is  too much confusion. This<br />
will happen  in every  nation all over the world. Might this<br />
theme strike  a chord  with our  man Bob?  Wine,  drink  and<br />
drunkenness come  up a  lot in Isaiah. In Isaiah 28 we get a<br />
vivid picture of prophets staggering around in confusion too<br />
drunk to  get their message across clearly. Hmmmmmm. Lots of<br />
vomit all  over the  place, that  kind of  scene. Arrogance.<br />
Earlier (Isaiah  5) evil was discussed. The example of those<br />
who are  doomed was of those who get up and then immediately<br />
start  drinking,   spending  long  evenings  getting  drunk,<br />
playing harps, tambourines and flutes, with no understanding<br />
of what  the Lord is doing. In Isaiah 19 we see how Egypt is<br />
in confusion,  doing everything  wrong,  staggering  like  a<br />
drunk slipping  on his own vomit. And in Isaiah 34 where God<br />
is punishing  his enemies  we see  the day of vengeance with<br />
its  line   of  confusion   and  chaos.  "There's  too  much<br />
confusion."<br />
<br />
In Isaiah 10 the Emperor of Assyria takes the credit for his<br />
military successes, not realising he is merely an instrument<br />
of the  Lord, like  a saw  or a  club is the instrument of a<br />
man. Missing  the real power causing things to happen, "None<br />
of them  along the  line know  what any  of it  is worth." A<br />
theme of  wine as  the blood  of Christ is here too (Matthew<br />
26:28),  drinking   sacramental  wine   without   a   proper<br />
consideration for its meaning.<br />
<br />
A banquet  is taking place when the disaster strikes Babylon<br />
in  Isaiah   21,  the   guests  are   eating  and  drinking.<br />
"Businessmen, they drink my wine".<br />
<br />
From the  watchtower a  sentry reports  two  men  coming  on<br />
horseback. This  is not good news. They tell us that Babylon<br />
has fallen.<br />
<br />
Moving on,  by Isaiah  25 God is preparing a banquet of rich<br />
food and fine wine on Mount Zion. Sorrow will be removed. He<br />
will destroy  death forever.  That is,  if you  trust in the<br />
Lord then  you will  be saved.  Familiar themes  in Judaism,<br />
Christianity, America and Dylan, yes?<br />
<br />
In Isaiah  30 God  descibes the  dangerous  country  of  the<br />
southern desert  where lions  live... lions  that  growl  in<br />
Isaiah 5,  carrying what  they have  killed and  guarding it<br />
fiercely. "Outside  in the  distance, a  wildcat did growl."<br />
Many people have commented that the substitution of wildcats<br />
for lions  and the like gives the song an American sheen, so<br />
the lyrics have a threefold application, to God, to America,<br />
and to Bob Dylan.<br />
<br />
And when  we get the description of God coming to rescue his<br />
people, the people of Israel, the descendants of Jacob, from<br />
east to  west everyone fears him and he arrives like a great<br />
strong wind! "The wind began to howl!".<br />
<br />
Isaiah 61 describes the deliverance, where the people of the<br />
Lord will  be so  well off  they will  have servants, hiring<br />
foreigners for labouring tasks, ploughing the earth, tending<br />
the animals, tending the vineyards. "Plowmen dig my earth."<br />
<br />
In Isaiah  62 the  promise of  no longer  being enslaved  to<br />
others is  made, their  grain is  no longer  to be  food for<br />
their enemies, foreigners will no longer drink their wine.<br />
<br />
Etc etc etc...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The structure of the song itself is unusual.<br />
<br />
It is  common for  people to comment that the song is rather<br />
circular, and  could start  differently from  how Bob  Dylan<br />
performs it, it could start with the title:<br />
<br />
All along the watchtower, princes kept the view<br />
While all the women came and went, barefoot servants, too.<br />
Outside in the distance, a wildcat did growl,<br />
Two riders were approaching, the wind began to howl.<br />
<br />
"There must be some way out of here," said the joker to the thief<br />
"There's too much confusion, I can't get no relief.<br />
Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth,<br />
None of them along the line know what any of it is worth."<br />
<br />
"No reason to get excited," the thief, he kindly spoke,<br />
"There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke.<br />
But you and I, we've been through that, and this is not our fate,<br />
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late."<br />
<br />
<br />
Then the  two riders  are the  joker and  the  thief.  Dylan<br />
himself could  be both  of these characters? Probably not in<br />
this context.  The joker  could be  Death, the  thief  Time?<br />
Probably  not.  Two  thieves  were  crucified  with  Christ.<br />
(Matthew 27)  Might the two riders we see be  Bob Dylan and Jesus  <br />
Christ, chatting together? Christ himself comes to those who<br />
do not  awake, do not turn from their sins, like a thief, in<br />
the message  to Sardis  (Revelation 3:3)  and  also  at  the<br />
assembly of  Armageddon (Revelation 16:15-16). If you knew a<br />
thief was  coming to  your house  you would be certain to be<br />
awake, yes? (Matthew 36)<br />
<br />
Anyway I  hope I  have scratched the surface of the Biblical<br />
elements in this one song, set some discussion in motion, so<br />
much more could be said. And do bear in mind this is how Bob<br />
Dylan writes BEFORE he has his born-again phase!<br />
<br />
Lot's to discuss for such a short song. I think Mr Dylan has<br />
given a  very profound presentation of his own inklings that<br />
Jesus was  coming to meet him. I have met many concert goers<br />
who are  bored with  this song  and think  it has been over-<br />
played as  a trusty crowd pleaser. But you and I, we've been<br />
through that,  and this  is not our fate, so let us not talk<br />
falsely now, the hour is getting late... :-)<br />
<br />
For many  of you  he will  be playing  this song  in a venue<br />
nearby soon.  Go and relisten. Watch especially his eyes. He<br />
ain't kidding  and this  is not  filler, it  is  essence  of<br />
Dylan.<br />
<br />
Now take it away with your ideas...<br />

			interesting and long, you seem to know a tun about the bible although im not sure how accurate you are relating it to the song. ive heard the theory about the song in a different order before, however i dont agree with it. in my opinion the watchtower is heaven. the women are the women who visited jesus's tomb (i forget thier names). and the barefoot servent is jesus. abbey road, john lenon barefoot, rumor hes dead, jesus died and was reencarnated. bam.<br />

			Very long... interesting about all these biblical references, but you don't give the answer: what's the message of the song? <br />
<br />
But you are right about his live performance. Dylan doesn't like to play his most famous songs, except All along the watchtower. I've seen him in Paris, he ended up with this song with so much emotion. He mixed the Hendrix's way to play it for the instrumental breaks with his way to play it for the verses. Great!			<div class="sign">
