				<strong class="title">General Comment</strong>As mentioned in previous posts, I view this song to be about class structure. The thief is symbolic of the lower class, and the joker of the middle class. They're approaching "The Watchtower", or a place where members of the upper-class reside, in an attempt to possibly begin a revolution. They're disgusted with the odious acts of those in power, and they realize that social change is necessary.

				<strong class="title">General Comment</strong>The AV is the definitive Bible in English, and here is the background to the song: <br />
<br />
Jesus is the "Thief" not the Joker.  He casts himself as a thief in many of his parables, and he was numbered "with the transgressors" - which is to say he was crucified with 2 thieves, and he was basically thief #3 to those that put him to death (although he was actually innocent). Jesus said his return would be, "as a thief in the night." Jesus is the thief. <br />
<br />
The "Joker" would have to be Judas Iscariot, portrayed in the song as a greedy and confused man, angry that others have the wine and lands he covets and wishes they belonged to him. <br />
<br />
Jesus told his disciples in advance that he would first be rejected and die - disappointing their hopes that he would usher in his earthly kingdom at that time. Judas' anger at the waste of the alabaster box of perfume poured out on Christ's feet (which he coveted to sell and pocket the money) was evidently the last straw.  At that incident, Judas proclaims what the perfume is "really worth" and its being wasted, but he is rebuked by the Lord Jesus Christ, who commended the woman. <br />
<br />
Seeing he had no hope to make money from Jesus Christ, he turned to the chief priests and betrayed Christ to them for 30 pieces of silver. <br />
<br />
At the betrayal, he falsely kissed Christ and called him "master" - speaking falsely. <br />
<br />
Within a few hours both were dead - "the hour is getting late" - Christ died on the cross, Judas hung himself. <br />
<br />
At Christ's crucifiction, it says "they sat down to watch" to see what would happen. This included the Jews, Roman soldiers, and the women who ministered to him - the Marys and his mother. The mention of  "barefoot" servants implies again the alabaster box that was poured upon Christ's bare feet by Mary - and the rite of washing one another's feet that Christ instituted among his disciples (i.e., the observing crowd included both his killers, and his devoted servants). <br />
<br />
Christ was crucified outside the city - hence "all along the watchtower" - which is also a cross reference to Isaiah 21 speaking of the fall of Babylon. Babylon represents the antitheses of Christ's coming kingdom: it is the ultimate government of this world, such as Rome (and its successors - today the USA). Hence Christ's death will, in fact, eventually come full circle in bringing the mighty kingdoms of this world to an end. <br />
<br />
The "wildcat" is the Devil - described as a "roaring lion" in the Bible, who goes about seeking who he may destroy. Although Christ rose again the third day, he left this world by ascending back into heaven bodily, from which he promises to return. <br />
<br />
So the riders and wind speak of the destruction of Babylon prior to Christ's return. <br />
<br />
With that background, here is the lyrics with notes:<br />
<br />
"There must be some way out of here," said the joker to the thief,<br />
[Judas doesn't want Christ to die - he wants Christ to rule the earth now, and make his disciples rich men]<br />
<br />
"There's too much confusion, I can't get no relief.<br />
[confusion - Judas is double hearted, filled with the devil, and therefore confused - he thinks money will solve his problems]<br />
<br />
Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth,<br />
[Others are in possession of the luxuries and lands that Judas thinks are his ("my") and he, the"religious dogooder" - he wants Christ to throw out the businessmen and farmers and give the property to Judas and the other disciples]<br />
<br />
None of them along the line know what any of it is worth."<br />
[Judas has keenly calculated the worth. But the lyric also suggests the profound statement that all those watching Christ died had no idea the worth of what they were witnessing: The blood of God paying for the sins of man - something infinitely more valuable than silver or gold]<br />
<br />
"No reason to get excited," the thief, he kindly spoke,<br />
[Jesus is kind to Judas, even calling him friend - Jesus is called "the thief" because he was numbered with the transgressors, and comes as a thief in the night, and as a thief, breaks into the goodman's house at an unknown hour, according to his own parable (sarcastically referring to the devil as the "goodman"!)] <br />
<br />
"There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke.<br />
[When Jesus told his disciples they would go to see Lazarus who had died, Thomas said, "Let us also go, that we may die with him." - a sick joke. Those among them were the fellow disciples, and the Jews and Romans who mocked Christ at his crucification. The fact that Judas sold his eternal life away so cheaply is the irony - that Judas' life was no joke - Christ said it had been better for that man "if he had never been born."]<br />
<br />
But you and I, we've been through that, and this is not our fate,<br />
[i.e., their fate was not to live a frivolous life - the lyric suggesting both would die, and the Thief being the one to prophesy it - Christ was crucified and Judas hung himself]<br />
<br />
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late."<br />
[The lyric is Christ saying he knows the Judas is betraying him with a false kiss at night in the garden, and the late hour being the time of death near]<br />
<br />
All along the watchtower, princes kept the view<br />
[As Christ was crucified outside the city, the rulers of the Jews and Romans watched him, and mocked him. The watchtower sees Christ dying, but they are also unwittingly witnessing an event like to Isaiah 21 - a herald of the coming destruction of "Babylon" - the fall of the mighty kingdom of this world. Christ's death brought the spiritual fall of Babylon over the souls of men - his future literal return to bring the literal fall of Babylon on this earth]<br />
<br />
While all the women came and went, barefoot servants, too.<br />
[the women were his loyal follwers - the men disciples (except for John) had all betrayed Christ and fled, but the women - including the Mary who had poured expensive purfume on his bare feet, remained crying.] <br />
<br />
Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl,<br />
[The devil, as the roaring lion, growls. Christ left the kingdom of this world to the devil for the time being, and soon Jerusalem was destroyed by Rome  - but, of course, it's an indeterminate "growl" for Christ's death defeated the sinful works of the devil by redeeming man to God - and the Devil's current rule in Christ's absence is temporary.] <br />
<br />
Two riders were approaching, the wind began to howl.<br />
[Armageddon is coming. The lyric puts the howling wind opposite the devil's growling - as the moving of time will quickly rushes along into the soon final conflagration and showdown].

				<strong class="title">General Comment</strong>Bob wrote this song after his motorcycle accident in 1967. He wrote it after reading the book of Isaiah in the bible, he specifically wrote it as his paraphrase or depiction of Isaiah 21. If you have never read Isaiah 21, I suggest finding a NIV bible for the best translation.

				<strong class="title">General Comment</strong>Wonderful song, I really love it, and everything about it. But. That. Damn. Harmonica. What's even the purpose of blowing into it at random point, it doesn't even have a tune to it. If you've ever attempted to listen to it via headphones, it's impossible, that damn harmonica makes your ears bleed.

			The Watchtower is just that, a corner tower that surveils the horizon from a city that's fortressed in biblical times.<br />

The Joker & the Thief are the lower rungs of society, Joker being the lowlyest of the higher palace chambers, the Thief being riffraff from the streets.<br />

Business men were plundering the simple man back then, and still do to this day, and they have never known what value there is to the world we inhabit.<br />

Princes were keepers of the relm, and the barefoot servents date the scene Dylan sings of, again, depicting biblical times.<br />

Wildcat growling is what someone already mentioned, insecurity outside the city walls.<br />
<br />
The two riders were Joseph & Mary, with Jesus in her womb, which is why the winds began to howl from that point on. Christ put the known powers that be on notice back then, and 2,000yrs later His name still resounds after only traveling within 100mi of his hometown.<br />

				<strong class="title">General Comment</strong>Ponder this,<br />
I've always felt this song had strong connections to J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-Earth, whether unintentionally or intentionally. The imagery is striking while taken in context.<br />
<br />
There must be some kind of way out of here, said the Joker to the Thief<br />
  - sounds alot like Gollum and Bilbo in the cave in "The Hobbit," Bilbo was recruited as a thief to steal back the dwarves gold, and Gollum told him he'd help him find the way out if he answered his riddles. The joker and the thief.<br />
<br />
The lines "This is not our fate" and "The hour's getting late" are often used by Tolkien in the Lord Of The Rings trilogy.<br />
<br />
Here's my favorite:<br />
The last stanza, to me, depicts the end of "Return Of The King"<br />
<br />
All along the watchtower<br />
  -Anybody know how to say watchtower in Elvish? It's Minas Tirith...the city of men where...<br />
<br />
Princes kept their view<br />
 - Faramir stayed and recovered while the men of the west went to war.<br />
<br />
While all the women came and went, barefoot servants too<br />
All the men of Minas Tirith went to war, leaving the women and the hobbit Merry at home along with Faramir. Btw, hobbits are ALWAYS barefoot.<br />
<br />
Ouside in the cold distance<br />
A wildcat did growl<br />
Two riders were approaching<br />
And the wind began to howl<br />
seems like Faramir and Eowyn looking to the east waiting for the sign that men won the battle.<br />
<br />
Again, probably not intentional, but it makes you think.
