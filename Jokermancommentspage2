				<strong class="title">General Comment</strong>This song is way more beautiful than people on here are giving it credit for, I think.  This is how I've always interpreted this song:<br />
<br />
It's about the things human beings do to be loved and respected.  Specifically, men work hard to become rich and powerful thinking that it will make people love them, when really it just makes them hate themselves.<br />
<br />
This idea really comes to life when he says "You look into the fiery furnace [the mirror], see the rich man without any name."  <br />
<br />
This strange human behavior sometimes has such a terrible impact on mankind, and I think that's what he's talking about when he says:<br />
"Well, the rifleman's stalking the sick and the lame,<br />
Preacherman seeks the same, who'll get there first is uncertain.<br />
Nightsticks and water cannons, tear gas, padlocks,<br />
Molotov cocktails and rocks behind every curtain,<br />
False-hearted judges dying in the webs that they spin,<br />
Only a matter of time 'til night comes steppin' in."<br />
<br />
In the end, we're all joking ourselves because this tendency ultimately leads to us feeling alone ("You rise up and say goodbye to no one") and hating ourselves ("the persecutor within").<br />
<br />
So in the end, I think that the "jokerman" is the listener.

				<strong class="title">General Comment</strong>I think Violent Sneezer above makes some good points about this enigmatic song.  Found a really good post about this (below) which seems to cover all scenarios.  False Prophet / False Messiah seems like the best fit, but it really is a riddle...<br />

				<strong class="title">My Interpretation</strong>This breakdown of the song Jokerman is long and indepth.  The song deals with human nature and God - it is not easy to define its meaning in a few sentences.  <br />
<br />
Dyan represents biblical concepts and interpretations of them throughout time and is singing to and about the jokerman. The song shows a very indepth knowledge Dylan has of the bible and of the human race.  Jokerman is not a specific person but a representation of a particular type of person.  The song 3 eras or times in the bible and the corresponding reaction during those times of the "jokerman" living in that time.  The 3 main times discussed are Jesus' time (his teaching and death), the birth of anti-Christ and the end times.  Jokerman's continuous denial of the acceptance of God is the theme of the song and each verse.  It is about this particular type of peron's (a jokerman) reaction to Jesus, Anti-Christ and the end times.  It is a song warning people and to some degree, regardless of warning, showing how a jokerman will react.  Jokerman is a well informed individual who has the ability to accept Jesus and knows what God wants.  Jokerman is a double-minded man (person) who is more interested in entertainment, popular opinion and foolishness.  Jokerman sits on the fence, trying not to offend anyone, not making waves, and he is lukewarm.  The jokerman is not stupid or ignorant, but rather foolish and world-focused as opposed to spritual.  His peronality in people is alive today, as it was in the past and will be in the future.  This song is about that type of person - not a specific individual in time.  The first part of every verse is biblical or reference to biblical themes.  The last 2 lines of each verse is about, or directed to Jokerman or whats going on as it relates to jokerman.<br />
<br />
Standing on the water, casting your bread<br />
while the eyes of the idol with iron head are glowing.<br />
Distant ships sailing into the mist, <br />
you were born with a snake in both of your fists<br />
While a hurricane was blowing<br />
Freedom, just around the corner from you<br />
but with truth so far off, what good will it do.<br />
<br />
This is clearly Jesus and Dylan is talking about his ministry and message.  Jesus walked on water and fed many with bread.<br />
Not only literal bread, but with "bread" for the soul.  This sentence shows both literal and figurative acts.  <br />
"Standing on the water, casting your bread" is Jesus teaching people (the water) with spriritual truth and a message (casting bread - meaning putting his message out to the world).<br />
The next line talks about the specific time in history in which Jesus is spreading his message. Jesus is teaching his message during the time when rome was in power.<br />
Rome at the time was an idol-based culture.  The iron head is rome - the world government at that time.  Refer to the book of Daniel and specifically the statue that Nebucanezzer sees in a dream for further detail on this.  This statue in Daniel represents all world goverments, past present and future.  Rome is represented by 2 iron legs.  Rome is the world government at the time of Jesus.  It is the head of the world statue and Rome is represented by iron - biblically.  So Jesus is teaching his message, spreading the word during a vibrant roman world rule.  - the "eyes of the iron head are glowing".<br />
<br />
"Distant ships sailing into the mist": People and disciples carrying his teaching and word into the world.<br />
Jesus was born with the purpose of defeating sin and Satan.  Satan is represented biblically by a snake (among other things).  Jesus was born<br />
with Satan in his fists and defeated him.  <br />
<br />
In the last two verses, there is a message for Jokerman.  Dylan is saying the freedom or gift of Jesus is quite attainable and "just around the corner"<br />
but in Jokerman's true form, he does not accept it.<br />
<br />
So the first verse is about Jesus' message, it went out into the world, it was done during roman rule - its free, its easy to accept but Jokerman doesn't accept it.  Jokerman here (as well as through history) is not "a" person but represents many people.<br />
<br />
So swiftly the sun, sets in the sky<br />
You rise up and say goodbye to no one<br />
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread<br />
both of their futures so full of dread, you don't show one<br />
shedding off, one more layer of skin<br />
keeping one step ahead of the persecutor within<br />
<br />
The first line is a very poetic description of the swift end to Jesus' life.  The sun set on his life at the age of 33.  <br />
Jesus was put on the cross (you rise up) and died.  He basically alone (said goodbye to no one).  He literally had thousands of followers but when the moment of death was upon him, people turned away.  He rose up on the cross and said goodbye to no one.  The jokerman (men) of that time turned their backs on him; ashamed and worried about puplic opinon and scrutiny.<br />
<br />
Fools (rushing about, world-focused, those who reject or refuse to accept Christ) do not show a future.  Angels know the future and it is full of dread.  The same applies to the fool.<br />
<br />
Last 2 lines again, are a message about Jokerman.  He knows what God wants and his conscience is eating away at him.  He attempts to reinvent himself shedding off another layer of skin.  Jokerman is a fickle person but he's not stupid.<br />
<br />
Each of the chorus', it could be mentioned, are the depiction of jokerman singing and dancing, enjoying life, oblivious to or ignoring the spiritual world.<br />
<br />
You're a man of the mountains, you could walk on the clouds<br />
manipulator of crowds, you're a dream twister<br />
You'll go to Sodom and Gommah but what do you care<br />
Ain't nobody there who wants to marry your sister<br />
A friend to the maytr, a friend to the woman of shame<br />
You look into the fiery furnace, see the rich man without any name<br />
<br />
The "mountains" in scripture represent government.  In the book of Revalation, you will find many details of the remaing aspects of this song.  All verses from here on in refer to Anti-Christ, the coming world government and Jokerman's response to all of it.  This verse introduces who the Anti-Christ is (as a leader) and what he is about.  In the tribulation period, Anti-Christ will be a world leader.  He will oversee all governements - Dylan captures this as "you're a man of the mountains".  This is without doubt Anti Christ.  He is the world leader and holds the highest power and position of all men and all governments, which become one (a one-world government with one leader), in the end times.  He "could walk on the clouds".  So, "you're a man of the mountains, you could walk on the clouds" is Anti Christ, the world leader, ruler and the verse speaks to the height of his power.<br />
Anti-Christ is not ignorant and he is very knowledgeable about God, Jesus and his own future.  He knows he will be defeated and he will be eternally bannished but he does't care about that.  He is not trying to impress anyone.  He knows he will go to "Sodom and Gommorah".  This is not significant to him and he is not out to impress  (although he will).  In other words, Dylan is saying, Anti Christ will go to Sodom and Gommorah in the end but he doesn't care, he's not out to impress.  (Referenced by "no one wants to marry your sister".)<br />
<br />
During the end times, a multitude of people will be killed for professing their conversion/belief and acceptance of Jesus.  These people are referred to as martyrs.  The woman of shame, is the beast, or in modern terms, the system of gonvernment which will exist at that time.  True to Jokerman's personality, he is playing both sides of the fence here.  He is a friend to the people killed for their acceptance of God and a friend to the system.  (A friend to the maytr, a friend to the woman of shame.)<br />
<br />
Jokerman is refusing to make a choice.  He is attempting to serve two masters which makes him a double-minded man.  His reluctance to whole heartedly choose God leaves him staring at himself in the fiery furnace.  (Rich man context: A man approaches Jesus and wants to "follow" him.  After some discussion, Jesus tells him to sell his things and come with him.  The man leaves sad because he has many things and does not want to part with them.  Jesus says, "it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than it is for a rich man to enter heaven")  The problem here isn't being rich.  The problem is that you can't serve 2 masters as Jokerman does.  The rich man (Jokerman) enjoys the high life too much.  The rich man does not make it to heaven because his master is money - not God.  He has "no name" because he did not choose God - therefore, his name was not written in the book of life (see revalation for details).  Jokerman is not a non-believer - he is a double-minded, fence sitting, lukewarm individual.<br />
<br />
Well the book of leviticus and deutoronomy<br />
the law of the jungle and the sea are your only teachers<br />
in the smoke of the twilight, on a milk-white steed<br />
Micelangelo indeed, could have carved out your features<br />
Resting in the fields, far from the turbulant space<br />
.....near the stars with a small dog licking your face<br />
<br />
As mentioned above, Anti-Christ is no fool.  He is exceptionally clever and smart, an amazing orator among many other attributes.  He, as is Satan, an expert in God's laws and the bible.  During Jesus' time, when Jesus was tempted by Satan, Satan twisted scripture from the old testament - often quoting from Gods Laws - those laws are found in the book of leviticus and deutoronomy.  Satan/Anti-Christ are bible scholars - they know exactly what's in the bible.   The old testament is broken out into two sections.  These sections are referred to as "The law and the prophets".  The book of leviticus and deutoronomy are to do with the law - God's law.  This verse says Anti Christ has 4 teachers by which he understands life (in a sense).  The first 2 are biblical books of the old testament.  The next 2 are the laws of the jungle and the laws of the sea.<br />
<br />
The law of the jungle is a scary thought.  This is a man (Anti-Christ) who believes in and leads (under disguise at first) with a respect for how junlge rules apply to life. The jungle is a dangerous place to live and the laws of the jungle have no regard for morals nor do they in any way mirror current society's rules (The jungle's rules are survial of the fittest - kill or be killed, eat or be eaten etc).  The law of the sea is equally disturbing.  The sea does not care who it takes when it is raging.  It will take young and old, rich and poor. We will be dealing with a very clever, well informed individual with a value system that is dark, sinister and uncaring.  He (Anti Christ) will not show his true colors at first.  But his value system is evil.<br />
<br />
Anti-Christ will come in diguise of a savior, figuratively, he will come to power riding a white horse (Revalation).  He is a master of deceipt and will come on a peace platform.  He unfortunately, will be exactly what the world wants.  This next piece of the song shows "a savior" coming in disguise.  We should know him for what he is when we see him; he should be so obvious to us.  The world's master artist could in fact depict Anti-Christ and carve out his very features.  We don't see him as that however.  Unfortunately, the majority will look to him to lead us to peace.  So Dylan says, "in the smoke of the twighlight" Anti Christ will appear to us riding a white horse - meaning he's disguised and comes to the world as a savior.  We should be able to spot him coming.  "Micelangelo, indeed could have carved out your features".<br />
<br />
The last two sentences again are comments about jokerman.  What's jokerman doing when this deceiver arrives?  Is he paying attention?  He is not, he is oblivious to what is going on around him.  Anti-Christ should be so obvious to Jokerman that Micelangelo could carve out his features.  Jokerman does not notice him - he is too busy enjoying life and foolishness.  Resting in the fields, far from the turbulant space<br />
.....half asleep neath the stars with a small dog licking your face<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, the rifleman's stalking the sick and the lame<br />
Preacherman seeks the same, who'll get there first is uncertain<br />
Nightsticks and water cannons, tear gas, padlocks<br />
Molotov cocktails and rocks behind every curtain<br />
False-hearted judges dying in the webs that they spin<br />
Only a matter of time 'til the night comes stepping in.<br />
<br />
This is the first 3.5 years of the last 7, known as the tribulation period. Anti-Christ is leading under a veil and is still on his peace platform but it is a faucaude.  His "army" is out stalking the sick and lame in an attempt to reduce the world's population and gain control.  The preacherman is as well targeting these people with the intent of saving them.  It is a very difficult time and Anti-Christ is still hidden behind a curtain.  Whether these people are killed or saved is uncertain.  Meanwhile, behind the curtain of peace, wars, imprisonment and mutany are well underway.  The last two lines are a warning to the Jokerman.  He says corruption is abound now in the world.  Judges (court, governement, policital) are all corrupt.  It is now only a matter of time before the curtain is pulled back revealing Anti-Christ as a ruthless dictator.  Once night comes "stepping in" there is no more light.  That signifies a total absence of any good in the world. Anti-Christ's reign will be truly revealed and the world will be living in the dark.<br />
<br />
It's a shadowy world, skies are slippery gray<br />
A woman just gave birth to a prince today and dressed him in scarlet<br />
He'll put the priest in his pocket, put the blade to the heat<br />
Take the motherless children off the street<br />
And place them at the feet of a harlot<br />
Oh, Jokerman, you know what he wants<br />
Oh, Jokerman, you don't show any response.<br />
<br />
<br />
This verse speaks to the actual birth of Anti-Christ and Jokerman's ultimate refusal to change his ways.<br />
At the time when Anti-Christ is born the world is "shawdowy and the skies are slippery gray".  This depicts a world that is losing moral ground. Government and man-kind is in a dangerous place.  The Anti-Christ is born and the mother dresses him in Scarlet. The "beast" or government system is dressed in scarlet (book of Revelation).<br />
<br />
Anti-Christ is wise to the power of religion.  In a true attempt to counterfiet Christ, Anti-Christ is made up of 3 parts.  The 3 parts are:The father - (who is Satan, the Dragon), the son - Anti-Christ, and the holy spirit - the holy spririt counterfeit is called the false prophit.  Anti Christ will have religion close to him - his false prophet.  He will have "the priest in his poket".  Anti-Christ will ensure he is aligned with a false religion.  Motherless children are people without direction, stability or proper guidance.  These people will become servents to the harlot - (which is the beast or system run by Anti-Christ)<br />
<br />
Today, armed with this knowledge, what is Jokerman doing?  He knows what's going on and he knows what's coming.  The Jokerman hears this song, he reads the bible and he knows what God wants.  Jokerman can not escape the trappings of the world and its lure to be entertained and distracted.  Jokerman enjoys the pleasures of sin too much.  He continues to reject the truth and God.  He knows what he (God) wants but he doesn't show any response.<br />
<br />
In summary, Dylan represents the span of the current age (from Jesus to the end) and the reaction from a particular type of person who refuses to accept God.  Dylan calls this person "Jokerman".

				<strong class="title">Song Meaning</strong>They say Dylan is a prophet, and I say this song very accurately describes Barack Obama...<br />
<br />
The subject's disrepect for freedom is a lot like Obama's impugning of the US Constitution. <br />
<br />
And: <br />
<br />
"Shedding off one more layer of skin" "Manipulator" "dream twister" is really Obama-like, w/ his failed Hope and Change promises.<br />
<br />
The subject also cozies to well-heeled special interests, but admonishes the rich, just like Obama in order to exploit. (as does Obama.)<br />
<br />
This line EXACTLY epiomizes Obama, who is a pop culture Idol. <br />
<br />
"The law of the jungle and the sea are your only teachers.<br />
In the smoke of the twilight on a milk-white steed,<br />
Michelangelo indeed could've carved out your features.<br />
Resting in the fields, far from the turbulent space,<br />
Half asleep near the stars with a small dog licking your face."<br />
<br />
The "Friend to the Martyr" reference is amazingly germain to Obama (and his warmth toward dictators) too. <br />
<br />
And then This:<br />
<br />
"It's a shadowy world, skies are slippery gray,<br />
A woman just gave birth to a prince today and dressed him in scarlet.<br />
He'll put the priest in his pocket, put the blade to the heat,<br />
Take the motherless children off the street<br />
And place them at the feet of a harlot.<br />
Oh, Jokerman, you know what he wants,<br />
Oh, Jokerman, you don't show any response."<br />
<br />
WOW...I think Dylan saw Obama years before Obama came to rule..

Who deceives weak minded people like you? The Cons. Who is always pretending to be holier than thou on a white steed? Cons, Obama does admonsih the rich that you seem to worship.

			Yes it is.  It really is frightening.   I can not find a verse that does not fit.  Except the dog licking the face.  And when I listen to Bob sing it.  He sounds like he is singing with a small dark look on his face.  I always understood this to be about the anti-christ.  But I listened to Bob's collection tonight and Jokerman came up and I thought to myself that this was a perfect detailed description of OBAMA.  If he had come out with this song today people would be talking.  Could Bob be a prophet?			<div class="sign">

				<strong class="title">General Comment</strong>It's where he is in his life now.  He is a baby boomer and that is a part of history that one really needs understand on so many levels.  What he is doing is taking his talent and reaching out to the off spring of baby boomers, and his own!  To me being a young baby boomer we thought we knew so much more than our parents.  Grow up and have a family of your own and you will see it is not that easy, nor pretty.  Parents of baby boomers had values and morals which is almost lost.  Dylan does make referrence to two parts of the bible and I see so many of my generation doing the same after a long vacation.  Not easy for a man let alone a generation to see where they were wrong.  Divorce falls mostly on baby boomers.  He is well aware of the younger generation being intune to the classic rock and he is doing his part to save with his art.  It's what you get and take with you that really matters.  This he knows.

				<strong class="title">General Comment</strong>The way I take it, it's more a disclaimer to religion and the idea of God in general.  The entire time, it shows an entire lack of divine intervention (assuming we're to see Jokerman as either God or Jahova).  "False-hearted judges dying in the webs that they spin", it stresses karma, not God's work.  He continually undoes the Judeo-Christian beliefs of an omnipotent and philanthropic God.  "Take the motherless children off the street/ And place them at the feet of a harlot./ Oh, Jokerman, you know what he wants,/ Oh, Jokerman, you don't show any response"  This creates a disturbing scenario where one can find no blame in those being punished, and then further goes to stress the "Jokerman"'s lack of involvement.  Even the chorus claims that, if there is a god, it certainly doesn't give a crap about the human race, as he's dancing to a simple nightengale tune while the world he's supposedly created falls into a hell.
