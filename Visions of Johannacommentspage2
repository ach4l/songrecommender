				<strong class="title">General Comment</strong>I think the lyric is "wallflower frieze", not freeze...  A frieze is an ornamental banding (a border) around the top of wall.  In this part of the lyrics, there's a sense that  you're inside a museum with art hanging on the walls.  There's also a sense that the "jelly faced women" might be images in paintings rather than visitors to the museum.  Then it goes deeper into abstraction "Hear the one with the moustache say, "Jeeze I can't find my knees", which when read literally means that one of the jelly faced women has a moustache.  Which gives you a sense that maybe someone defaced the painting  with the archetype method - a moustache.  This particular painting is a portrait, much like Mona Lisa, as the painting ends at the torso... there are no legs.... no knees.  Jewels and binoculars on a mule?  Artistic expression is capable of being both abstract and absurd.  Interesting, also, a mule is a cross between a horse and a donkey and unable to reproduce.

				<strong class="title">General Comment</strong>Hi i think it's essentially stream of consciousness, but i think it's about "making art". about wanting to make something that will survive him. Maybe that's where the Van Gough Johanna comes in. i think it's a bit like the yeats  - the circus animals desertion and the foul rag and bone shop of the heart. He's searching for inspiration, and Louise although holding a handful of rain is too "real" and is coming up short in being his muse. For me the conflict is that Johanna (abstraction of art) is working for him as a muse, but he actually loves louise (life). <br />
<br />
I don't know how to express how I mean. he's rejecting the pedlar/countess artist/benefactor relationship because he won't be able to use Louise as his muse, but rather whatever the countess desires. To me the reference to the Mona Lisa and the opera and the stage and the fiddler show that he's considering other art forms and comparing himself. He feels that he's coming up short. He's got a harmonica instead of a paint brush and the skeleton keys (musical keys) and he's worried that people won't be listening to harmonica recordings in 300 years time, but the harmonica is all he has.... But he then concludes that it's not the form of expression of art that's important, but the muse itself - which is why it's visions of Johanna that remain (in his mind and in our minds). at that point I think that Johanna represents both the muse and a real muse combined and louise and Johanna are the one person. He's trying to reconcile his muse being a real person. <br />
<br />
According to the internet Johanna means "god is gracious" and louise means ~"fame and war or famous warrior."

				<strong class="title">General Comment</strong>Ofcourse understanding lyrics is a personal thing, and is diffrent to everyone else, But why do people always link 60 lyrics with drugs? Louise LSD and Johanna Heroin... cmn? really? t's not because all this geniusses took drugs that all there lyrics are about drugs. <br />
<br />
anyways what i think about this lyrics, one of my all time favourites? <br />
In short i think it's about everyone has a dream partner, someone special, that lives in your mind. Someone who fully understands you, someone who you can love untill eternity. It seems like your 2nd part that fits perfectly with you. Sadly, its a person that only lives in your mind. Johanna. Now there are alot of girls (or men, for the women reading this) who come close to this Johanna figure. And when your in love with someone , your mind shapes the person as this Johanna, she's perfect. however, someday you'll loose intrest and discover that this Louise is not Johanna at all.. she's just a person with bad sides too. <br />
Now the big question is, Is louise worth loving. she seems so small and full of "errors" compared to Johanna. <br />
<br />
(Louise, she's all right, she's just near<br />
She's delicate and seems like the mirror<br />
But she just makes it all too concise and too clear<br />
That Johanna's not here)<br />
<br />
But the truth is ... You'll never meet Johanna. Shes not there. She doesn't exist. <br />
Thanks for reading !

				<strong class="title">General Comment</strong>"The harmonicas play the skeleton keys and the rain"<br />
<br />
Since is the conclusion to the song I am feeling it is an image of the entire song wrapped into one phrase. The harmonicas representing himself, the skeleton keys representing the accessibility to the Louise figure directly relating to the ghost of 'lectricity howls in the bones of her face, and the rain of course, which Louise is daring him to defy but can't, and all that's left is the elusive Johanna.

				<strong class="title">Song Meaning</strong>Visiona of Johanna is a great song. It certainly is NOT about any woman, called Johanna or otherwise. At the time Dylan wrote it he was basically Heroin dependent and had had a wide experience with various drugs. He personifies LSD as Louise and Heroin as Johanna.<br />
<br />
Verse 1.<br />
<br />
Simply describes a group of people sitting in a New York loft apartment (like his own at the time) with the radio playing quietly awaiting an LSD trip to begin. Anyone who has had LSD experience will know the feeling of being 'stranded' in that at the start of a trip you know you will have to go through the whole thing lasting 12-18 hours. There is no early way out. The line "And Louise holds a handful of rain, temptin' you to defy it" refers to the hallucinatory 'rain' or trouble which the LSD will be 'tempting' the drug taker (Bob Dylan) to overcome/deal with. The line "In this room the heat pipes just cough" refers to the heighten sensory perception which LSD gives the taker causing them to notice even the tiniest sounds. The "visions of Johanna" are Bob's dreams/memories of the stronger more physical effects of Heroin. He is saying the LSD induced hallucinations fail to mask his physical desire for Heroine. These are "conquering his mind". He was probably hoping that taking acid would in some way relieve his desire for Heroine. No way...<br />
<br />
Verse 2<br />
<br />
The ladies (or "all night ladies" because they both will keep the taker up all night!) LSD & Heroine. The two drugs one real the other imagined are playing "blind man's bluff with the key chain" in the empty lot of his mind. The key chain being the way out of this trip. In other words he cannot see any way out of this experience and is at the mercy of these ladies. Louise is Dylan's codeword for LSD. She is just near because he has just taken a tab of acid. She is like the mirror (code for a mind) because as anyone who has ever taken acid knows it is an entirely mental experience. It plays games with your mind. Louise (LSD) merely clarifies to him that Johanna (Heroin) is not there - just her. The "ghost of electricity" actually refers to the physical sensation ones gets when using acid. It feels like you can sense a electric current flowing through the bones of your face. Accurate description oddly enough not poetic license here!<br />
<br />
Verse 3<br />
<br />
The little boy is clearly Bob Dylan. Under acid you can actually see yourself as if you were another person. You can judge yourself harshly too as he does here. He describes how "he likes to live dangerously!" - well taking class A drugs certainly would qualify. He was probably think "What a mess I am in now". The muttering small talk at the wall is reference to the way when under acid you actually verbalise question/answers to your self. Sometime out loud. Again his craving for heroin is dominating his trip. It would do as when you take acid you would expect your trip to be about what was on your mind before you took it. In this case Heroin.<br />
<br />
Verse 4<br />
<br />
He is well and truly under the influence of the acid now. The museums represent his memories. The voices would be in his own head - aspects of his own consciousness. He is relating himself to the enigmatic mona lisa whose smile is ambiguous. Like he himself at that time does not know whether he is honestly enjoying his experience but he has to get through it somehow so he is putting on a fake smile. His knees are turning to jelly. He is well under now. The jewels represent ideas, the binoculars visions (or dreams). He means he is experiencing wonderful ideas and hallucinations but at the same time seeing his physical body (the mule) as where these wonderful ideas and visions are coming from. Most acid takers are at some stage of their trip disgusted with their own bodies. All this is going on but still the physical craving for heroin is making a mockery of it and that is why "it seems so cruel".<br />
<br />
Verse 5<br />
<br />
Dylan himself is raving at his drug (LSD -who he now calls "the Countess" as an insult because the title indicates self importance.) The parasite reference is to himself because he considers his use of both drugs parasitic but at the same time that the drugs are like parasites to him. The "empty cage now corrodes" refers to the fact he is now coming down from the LSD experience. His skeleton keys have got him out once again from a difficult encarceration. Many never get out is has to be remembered. "Everythings been returned which was owed" refers to the fact that you get nothing for nothing with acid <br />
and at the end you give back what you owed. Everything. His conscious feels like it is exploding along with his consciousness no doubt! He feels his own guilt because he plays with these ladies (LSD & Heroin) neither have his best interests at heart.<br />
<br />
The final line reminds us that after his acid trip nothing has been done to alleviate his craving for Heroin. Why would it. LSD is a non addictive drug which is actually negatively addicting meaning the more you take it the less likely you are to want to take more.<br />

				<strong class="title">General Comment</strong>Johanna is a ghost who haunts Bobby Mackey's night club in Wilder, KY.  There are other ghosts who haunt the club there from back when it was s slaughterhouse.  There is a well in the basement believed to be a portal to Hell.  EEk.  Anyway, Johanna committed suicide there in the 30's over a singer she loved who played there.  Her father the owner killed the singer she was in love with.  She tried to poison her father and then killed herself.  She haunts by laughing, crying, hugging, talking, and leaving a scent of rose perfume.  She is the one suspected of playing the juke box even when unplugged, with the song, "Anniversary Waltz".  Bobby D is makin direct references to this American legend in "Visions of Johanna". With the night club's legends content about a hell's gate and that Johanna's incident was in the 1930's explains why people who are reviewing the meaning of this song can see references in it to Nazi Germany as well.  That building had been known to be used for Satanic Rituals in the early 1900's and Nazis belong in that catagory of evil. I  love how Bob Dylan can connect history and put it in an eerie love song.

				<strong class="title">My Interpretation</strong>Here's my interpretation of the song, and it is by no means a 100% accurate, but this is what I gather from the song: now, the WWII allegory thing is bogus but I do think it has a WWII setting, judging by the "hear the one with the mustache say..." and "in the museums infinity goes up on trial" lines. It's about a woman named Louise and her lover who have locked themselves into a desolate rural cabin, and she's slowly losing her grip on sanity and keeps seeing visions of a mysterious, intangible figure named Johanna, while her lover feels the need to try and go find her, yet fearing the idea of abandoning her ("while my conscience explodes") of envy and jealousy, as the visions of Johanna have slowly "taken his place", also feeling himself falling into the hole Louise's in, and ends up leaving her (to someone with a fish truck?). Now obviously this song is a trail-blazing symbolism extravaganza and I'm not sure if all of it is supposed to make complete sense, but that's what the song's about in my opinion.
