				<strong class="title">General Comment</strong>From what ive heard,this song is sung backwards, so from what i could piece to gether its just a little tale about a crumbling society thats about to go through great change through the actions of two men.<br />
<br />
The last verse describes the place with princes watching over the city and its servants, as two men come charging in the distance. The two previous verses as i see it are the conversation thats taking place as these two men ride to the palace/kings home in hope of a revolt or change of some kind.<br />
<br />
The Joker represents the honest working man who is always taken advantage of inspite of his hard work,"Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth,<br />
None of them along the line know what any of it is worth."<br />
while the theif represents the man who has the chosen the dishonest but easier way of life. They have both come to an understanding over the patetic realities of life as the thief says " There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke".<br />
As they approach the palace he says however that all the sad facts the joker is speaking of will not be there fate as they are going to confront their leader and hopefully bring about some kind of change.<br />
<br />
Thats pretty much all i could get.

				<strong class="title">General Comment</strong>The joker is the contemporary social critic. In the kingâs court, he is the only one who can get away with telling the truth about the state of the kingâs affairs, because he does it through comedy. In this poem, the joker is criticizing those who would receive the fruits of the earthâs bounty, but receive it in a manner of ignorance. They take from the earth but donât give back, and for them itâs all for profit and instant gratification. Civilization doesnât respect the earth the way the natives did, and ego-tripping allows some humans to think that they own nature or can control it. So the joker must be desperately crying out to his companion, the thief, from the perspective of the earth.<br />
The thief tries to calm down the joker by telling him how the two of them, who once thought along the lines of the aforementioned businessmen and plowmen, now have a matured and responsible outlook on life. They are no longer greedy and self-indulgent when it comes to taking into account the needs of our planet, though he acknowledges they once were like everyone else.<br />
But the thief adds a new element into the picture by saying how everyone else thinks life is not only a goodie bag but something not worth fighting for. On some level, I think life can be a joke; I mean, not only do we take ourselves too seriously oftentimes, but life can be full of paradoxes and coincidences that can only be laughed at; ideally, life is a playground for those virtuous enough to perceive it that way. But I donât think thatâs what the message of the poem is; I think the thief is referring to those who waste their lives and donât grow up. I donât mean âgrow upâ as in ceasing all silliness, I mean âgrowing upâ as in being responsible and mature, which would entail not harming the earth or any of its creatures, and not giving back to society.<br />
So on some level, life is a joke, because people need to lighten up. On the other hand, some people are fun to laugh at but not much fun to be around; other jokers are those who aspire to live a self-centered life, living carelessly, recklessly, irresponsibly, and sadistically all their life. This paradox may be the source of the jokerâs confusion.<br />
âLetâs stop talking falsely now,ââthis could mean, âletâs grow up by stop being hypocrites. Letâs stop pretending we knew everything as teenagers. Letâs stop believing the lies society has fed us. Letâs stop thinking itâs okay to do what we used to do, because itâs time for us to rise above a second childhoodâlet us learn to stop kidding around.â I know itâs fun to say mean jokes, even off-color jokes that poke fun at groups of people, but be better people. Letâ s be role models. Letâs rise above the B.S. and raise the standards of living. Letâs get active in the system, doing our social responsibility to Mother Earth and our fellow man, no matter how small a part we appear play, it is still necessary; it isnât really small at all.<br />
I think the fact that the line about businessmen and plowmen are stealing from the earthâand by doing so making themselves thievesâis directed at âthe thiefâ is meant to be ironic. This may be true because the parallel is the thief says to the joker, âthere are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke.â The key is a joker is complaining to a thief about thievery and a thief is complaining to a joker about jokers, and they seem to be fed up with their lot and realizing they need to change- hence, âthe hour is getting late.â<br />
<br />
The second part of the poem remains cryptic to me. Why would princes keep a view along the watchtower? Why wouldnât he have his hired men to do that for him? Has he come to some conclusion that he needs to be responsible for watching out for his security, rather than depend on others to do it for him? Could this be a metaphor that applies to you and me, to society as a whole, or to the political regime? The women and the barefoot servants give more credence to the latter idea that it has to deal with a political regime, since the lyrics present the hierarchy of nobility. Is he proclaiming that lovers come and go, and those who serve you (friends?) come and go, so donât let your guard down because itâs only a passing alliance? I donât think heâs that cynical, but he could be. Given the global turmoil of the sixties and seventies, and the fact Dylan is using a political hierarchy in his lyrics, it seems reasonable to interpret these lyrics on a grander scale, and less offensive to hope and individual human nature. Besides, the first half of the song was evidentially aimed at giving a message to society as a whole, so why should the second half all of a sudden break from that audience? He could be giving his comments on politics, that collective human nature that emphasizes security and foreign relations due to resource dependency. This song was released in 1967, so the Vietnam War was in full effect. His message could be interpreted as âdonât get caught up in other countriesâ agendas. They may seem to be as friendly as a lover and as giving as a servant today, but we canât act as of it will last, or put all our eggs in one basket, in the same way itâs wise to not get into a personal relationship with someone and have it be imbalanced. We need to gaze on all countries, no matter what alliances we may have made with them, with a cool, impersonal eye. This was also a time of minority struggle, so this same message might be applied to blacks, hippies, women, gays, farmers; anyone who has come together to make sure their interests are protected in the face of civilization.<br />
<br />
âOutside in the distance a wildcat did growl, <br />
Two riders were approaching, the wind began to howl.â<br />
Are the two riders the joker and the thief, come to tell the prince their newfound perspective on life? Does the growl symbolize a primal scream for a change, perhaps through violent means? Does the howling wind mean that the pressure has come on, and the time is now to resist the urge to revert back to immature thinking, or the thinking of previous generations before us? These two lines are especially ominous. I think theyâre saying that we need to act on, and not just think about, about what we need to do. Planning is all good, but look outside the window, folks. Thereâs race riots, thereâs a war based on reasons we donât even think are worth fighting for, thereâs police beating hippies in the streetsâ¦the struggle is here, waiting for us to resist and adapt and do all we can so come out on top in order for society to progress. The paradigm shift in consciousness is near at hand, the world is ready to wake up! We need you NOW!

				<strong class="title">General Comment</strong>first stanza is partly taken from isiah`s prophecy about rich man who plunder the country without them knowing what theyve done. `they drink my wine, they plow my lands`<br />
<br />
Now Dylan had some interest in tarot cards even though he did not believe in them. he did take some imigary from them. The joker refers to Jesus. The thief revers to the thief on the cross, or all sinners, lets say mankind. <br />
<br />
Then there is some more reference to the book of isiah. the prophecy about the betrayal by Judas iscariot. God is paid 30 silverlings. the did not know what JHWH was worth.<br />
<br />
<br />
So stanza 1: God is crying and getting angry.<br />
<br />
in the second stanza the thief comforts the joker and is trying to convince him that there still is some good left in the world, just like abraham used to do before God destroyed soddom and gommorah.<br />
<br />
So stanza 2:: God is being persuaded not to bring down his judgement.<br />
<br />
then, in the 3rd stanza the song takes a shift. This part is completely taken from the book of kings. It tells the story of Jehu. Who killed all who kneeled before Baal and after that rides up to Achab to murder him for his transgressions. The sons of Achab (princes) see, while standing on a watchtower, that Jehu is aproaching. Barefoot servants of Achab try to convince Jehu to stop, but Jehu ignors them and keeps on riding. He is unstopable, for noone rides like Jehu.<br />
<br />
So stanza 3: God will send his judgement if evil man continue to live the way they did.<br />
<br />
Now the moral of this story is: God does not approve of evil man and even though he listens to our prayers and is mild and meek in his judgement. In the end He is the Righteous one and will not let evil triumph.

				<strong class="title">General Comment</strong>The song does reference Isaiah 21 and was written during a period in Dylan's life when he was secluded and spent a great deal of time reading the scriptures. While Dylan sometimes does have Jesus references, even before his short-lived "born again" period, his background is Jewish. There are no overtly Christian references in this song. Dylan took a biblical passage about the collapse of Babylon and turned it on its head by imagining a conversation about the meaning of life between a thief and a joker in the city. <br />
<br />
It is true that Don McClean used the image of Dylan himself as a "jester" or "joker" in "American Pie" and Dylan consciously embraced imagery from that song, such as in "Shelter from the Storm," where he references McClean's line about the jester stealing the king's "thorny crown." But this song predates American Pie, so no dice on that theory.

				<strong class="title">General Comment</strong>All I want to say at the moment is, this song was used so incredibly well on Battlstar Galactica. They could have totally blown it, using a popular Earth song to "turn on" the newly discovered Cylons, but man, they pulled it off. And the version by Bear McCreary and Bt4 they composed for the show is amazing.

			Totally ditto Obsessive0514's comment! "This song was used so incredibly well on Battlstar Galactica...And the version by Bear McCreary and Bt4 they composed for the show is amazing."<br />
<br />
I read most of the comments here. And how amongst all it's allegory, whether it's Jesus as the joker, or two of the horsemen of apocalpse, or the song being about the crisis of existence itself (which is what Battlestar Galactica is about), it alludes to Apollo and Starbuck from BSG too!			<div class="sign">

				<strong class="title">General Comment</strong>after reading several of the interpretations here, I personally think it is about jesus dying on the cross, or at least Dylan had this in mind while writing.<br />
<br />
jesus is on the cross and second-guessing his fate, he sees trouble with the world and wants to escape it, but he doesn't want to dye either. the thief says, in the most intriguing line, that both he and jesus have been through life, and that living further on earth is not their fate, and to accept this. the title couplet sets location and political/class unfairness. the final 2 lines signify the coming of death.

				<strong class="title">General Comment</strong>This song is obviously about BATMAN!! The joker is talking to TwoFace about escaping batman's clutches...<br />
The business man is Bruce Wayne and the princes are the Gotham police\Commisioner Gordan with the bat-signal. A wild cat---cat woman!!---two riders---Batman AND Robin. The plowed earth is the batcave. It's obvious!! Two face and the Joker want to kill batman. In 1968 batman was on nbc in COLOR. Dylan wrote this after watching an episode. Using bat-technology from 1968 I have solved the "riddle"!!
