				<strong class="title">General Comment</strong>To me, I always felt he was singing to his muse.  That may or may not be true, but that's what I like to think.  <br />
<br />
"Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood" - looking back on the early part of his career.<br />
"blackness was a virtue" - everyone was trying to immitate the blues artists.<br />
"the road was full of mud" - but a legitimate artist had to pay true dues to reach his destination.<br />
"I came in from the wilderness, a creature void of form" - he's just another folk artist without a voice.<br />
"come in she said I'll give you..." - I like to think he found SOMETHING that helped channel his emotions.  The lines proceeding this have nothing to do with women - it has to be taken in context.<br />
<br />
Again, this is just what I like to think and ALWAYS WILL because it speaks to me.

				<strong class="title">General Comment</strong>One should avoid the temptation to read explicit literal interpretations into songs that suggest their meanings through symbolism and imagery â like Dylanâs Shelter from the Storm.  Where the narrator may at times be pictured as a warrior or Christ-like figure, this is clearly not the literal meaning of the song, which is about the redemptive power of love, and looks back on a specific love affair from a present in which the male and female are separated.  Dylan uses the word ânowâ and the present tense when he chooses to contrast the past with his state in the present:<br />
<br />
âNow thereâs a wall between us, something has been lostâ<br />
âNow Iâm living in a foreign countryâ<br />
âIf I pass this way againâ etc.<br />
<br />
The events of the past, which Dylan remembers in the song, are, figuratively, âanother lifetimeâ: Dylan is metaphorically reborn by his encounter with the merciful woman.  Each verse presents images of harshness and suffering which are eased by the intervention of the female: ââCome in,â she said, âIâll give you shelter from the storm,ââ concluding every verse.<br />
<br />
The womanâs selfless act of charity offers redemption to a sinful world where âblackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud.â  âIn a world of steel and death and men who are fighting to be warm,â she alone shows kindness and compassion, giving the narrator the chance to relieve his âexhaustionâ.  He is "hunted like a crocodile" and in the first verse is even depicted as "a creature without form": yet she speaks to him as another human.  Being âhunted like a crocodileâ, âpoisoned in the bushes and blown out on the trailâ are thus symbols for the woes and troubles of the world, from which the compassion of the woman offers respite.  <br />
<br />
This dichotomy is in the songâs title: Shelter from the Storm, the storm being the black and muddy wilderness of toil and blood, steel and death, in which new-born babies and old men alike are abandoned âwithout love.â  In contrast, the shelter offered by the woman is âalways safe and warm.â  She herself is pictured as a saintly, Classical figure with âsilver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair,â an image that recalls Diana or the Virgin Mary: âShe walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns.â<br />
<br />
Dylanâs sufferings, too, reach their ultimate conclusion when he is imagined as Christ, dying on the cross for the sins of the world.  (The New Testament tells how soldiers gambled for Christâs clothes.)  This is not to say that the narrator is, or believes he is, Christ.  The point of the comparison is that, as Christ was reborn to redeem the world, so Dylanâs âinnocence,â his faith in humanity, is restored by the selfless offer of shelter from the woman.<br />
<br />
Like many of the songs on Blood on the Tracks, Shelter from the Storm looks back on a love affair from the perspective of the present.  The narrator is now âliving in a foreign country,â cut off from his old lover: âNow thereâs a wall between us.â  He wishes he could turn back the clock and have a second chance; last time he âtook too much for granted, got my signals crossed.â  In the context of an album filled with songs of bitterness and regret, however, Shelter from the Storm has a tone of acceptance and thankfulness for the time Dylan and his lover did spend together.<br />

				<strong class="title">General Comment</strong>Here's what happens in this story, in chronological order with verses referenced (as the song is definitely not in order)<br />
<br />
First thing's first. He "offered up his innocence, and got repaid with scorn." (while we're at it, does that sound like anyone else in history?) (verse 9)<br />
<br />
That scorn came in the form of a "lethal dose." ( verse 9)<br />
<br />
After that he "came in from the wilderness." (died?) and was a "creature devoid of form." (oh yeah, definitely died) (verse 1)<br />
<br />
The world he just "died in" had "roads full of mud" and "blackness was a virtue." Kinda sounds like a place where you could get lethally poisoned while people played dice for your pants. (verse 1)<br />
<br />
Ok, so he's standing there after having just died. And he hears a females voice say "come in, I'll give you shelter from the storm."  (verse 1)<br />
<br />
For a second, this guy and the voice just sit there. Nothing was said between them, and everything in this moment is "unresolved," If this guy had just died, he'd probably be wondering what's going to, you know, happen to him? But didn't he just say "there was little risk involved?" When the question of heaven/hell is before you, how could there not be any risk involved? Well, the guy says, "Try imagining a place that's always safe and warm." (verse 3)<br />
<br />
Queue angel (or whatever). The speaker of the voice emerges, the guy describes her as having silver bracelets, and flowers in her hair. She "gracefully" (full of GRACE, or quite literally, the love of god) walks up to him and removes his crown of thorns. Man that's some familiar symbolism. I mean, remember, when the guy TELLING this story had HIS innocence repaid with scorn? Just like, you know, JESUS. (I can't even type Jesus in capslock without hearing it in my head as a Southern Evangelist Preacher). (verse 5)<br />
<br />
Ok, so she takes his crown of thorns, and then SOMETHING happens. It's not really clear what. But That's pretty much the end of the "action." Wherever he was, with this angel, isn't described any further in the present tense. And then we can see that pretty much the other half of the verses are devoted to this guy's "thoughts" on his(possibly near-death) experience. <br />
<br />
I mean, he says "if I pass this way again, you can rest assured<br />
I'll always do my best for her, on that I give my word<br />
In a world of steel-eyed death, and men who are fighting to be warm.<br />
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm." (verse 2)<br />
<br />
So at some point after his experience our(narrator/antagonist)guy is back in the crap world again (ours) promising someone that he will do his best to "live up" up to the beauty he experienced. Even in a world of ugliness, filled with men "fighting to be warm," and "steely-eyed death." He's changed by this experience, and strives for something greater. Maybe even godliness? Hey! Who else was godly while on Earth? Maaaybe the same guy that died sort of like our hero, and wore the same head-wear? Man Bob Dylan is obvious with his references....<br />
<br />
And the guy talks some more about the difficulties of living in our crap world after having experienced God or whatever it is he experienced. "There's a wall between us," he "got his signals crossed." It's been awhile since that "long-forgotten morn," and his connection with "her" (or god in some form) isn't quite as strong anymore. (verse 6)<br />
<br />
Oh, and in the verse missing from the above lyrics, he says "the bonds are broken, but can be retied." Is this sinking in? He visited god (bond) and is now back on earth (broken) and knows he will join god again (retied). But while he's here, he wants one more "journey through the woods," and THAT keeps his "spirit tied." Even though he knows that life on Earth is a "neverending battle." he isn't quite ready to leave. <br />
<br />
The only remaining verses in the song deal with this guy's changed perception of the world around him. <br />
<br />
The undertaker now "blows a futile horn." It's futile because our protagonist now knows what really awaits us after death. <br />
<br />
Someone comes up and talks to our guy about "babies wailin'" and "old men with broken teeth. Just like our guy used to be, this poor soul is lost and confused, and thinks it might be "hopeless and forlorn." Our guy knows that only life on Earth is hopeless and forlorn.<br />
<br />
Last paragraph ties it all in pretty straightforward. Yet again, he's talking about living in a "foreign country," although he's "bound to cross the line." (C'mon, is this not very obvious by this point?). "Beauty walks a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine." Again, being godly while on Earth, returning back to the place where he experienced true beauty, etc. And finally, the last line is wishing he could go back to that wonderful place where he felt such warmth and love,"when GOD and HER were born." Notice the word "born." GOD and HER were sort of... born into his world, and his experience was kind of like giving birth, I guess, in that there's no "going back in." <br />
<br />
So yeah, Bob's a pretty cool dude, and I think he's capable of talking about way "more" than commentary on a war, or another love song. This song rocks.<br />
<br />

				<strong class="title">General Comment</strong>I think part of what makes this song so incredible is its ambiguity. I do believe that he wrote most of this album about his divorce, and this song is no different. But "shelter from the storm" can really refer to anything that can lure us in with pleasant comfort - sex, drugs, love (to an extent), but on which our dependence can be dangerous. I believe for dylan (and for many) it is about how a woman he was in love with provided him with shelter from the storm of stress and (maybe?) depression that riddled his, and any other, life. This, I think is the reason for the biblical and war allusions. The war is his internal turmoil from which she gives him shelter, the christ allusion refers to his feeling of betrayal and suffering when the shelter of his relationship collapses. But what makes this song so terrific is that it applies just as easily to a soldier, his shelter being either morphine (or heroin) or more psychotropic substances that give him shelter from the PTSD. The beauty of dylan's intentional ambiguity is that they apply on a broad scale to anybody who has fallen for shelter, and in so doing, lost his/her independence.

			Agree. It could be a number of things. His divorce or heroin as someone else said also. Or, something else altogether where we find solace, but  where dependency has it's own consequences. Ambiguity is why it's such an amazing song and without Dylan chiming in we'll never quite know. 			<div class="sign">
