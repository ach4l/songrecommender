/n1st - pretty obvious that it is a person at the funeral of their partner, most likely the spouse.  this is given away by the "I wasn't born to lose you" which is the opposite of the common phrase said between lovers "it was like i was born to be with you".  All these instruments that would be seen at the lenghty process of burying someone are telling him to let go, but he cant, as they scorn him and he feels turned against the world because his second half is gone.  this is an intense longing that actually depresses the speaker, as most love does.  so this is a man losing his wife and becoming a widow<br />
/n
/n<br />
/n
/n2nd - first two lines signify pretty heavily a soldier that has been sent to a war that has little purpose, or even if it had purpose, is being ran irrationally (a heavy theme of the time), since the politician is drunk (foolish) and is playing w/ the hearts of the soldiers mothers.  saviors as in the soldiers (so dylan differentiates between a soldier and the foolish person controlling the soldiers, even if he himself doesn't support soldiers, it is the speaker that does since they long for their sibling/son/any relative) are sleeping, hence dead.  the speaker is a relative that is waiting for this soldier to return home, even though he slightly knows this wont happen, and ask him to "open the gate for mom" or something along those lines as she runs to her soldier son.  another form of deep longing and love<br />
/n
/n<br />
/n
/n3rd - cant quite place in context of the song, something to do w/ men not being able to love in the same manner as women, but its nonetheless still love<br />
/n
/n<br />
/n
/n4th - one of the most classic examples of love, as both friendship and passion.  a man returning to his "queen of spades" a figure that is heavily iconic of an arranged and loveless marriage or a hoity toity woman that doesn't deserve the man, but he is stuck, probably due to money (ill get into why this is important).  so he returns to his chamber maid, someone who is a dear servant and always "good" to him.  he describes her as what one thinks of as true love, "not afraid to look at her" means that he isn't afraid to look past her social labels to see who she REALLY is, even if society doesn't condone it.  the social acceptance rings in again because she is obviously poor, and he cannot be with her because he, a noble, couldn't be with her.  nonetheless she and him both know where he wants to be (deeply with her and not w/ his socalled queen) but it doesn't matter because he is socially stuck w/ someone else, who is implied to be the anithesis of this chambermaid, but he still cannot stop these feelings. like romeo and juliet if juliet was poor and romeo was married<br />
/n
/n<br />
/n
/n5th - either aging jealousy or standard jealousy, resulting from an intense longing that like every other instance cannot be satiated.  dancing child w/ his chinese suit probably doesnt mean child, but an insult to a woman that is dating someone who is younger and is not of her culture (some can think of this as he therefore is stealing her, but thats not what i get).  took his flute > VERY symbolic of how in fables someone will play a flute and it will entrance them, as if he is hypnotizing this woman that he loves.  he was mean to him ("not cute") because: he lied to his love, he is taking her on a ride (of emotion, so abuse, and leading her on, his intentions are not founded, and is thus NOT for the true love that he hold) and also once again that time was on his side, he was younger and more active/energetic/spirited etc. (here comes in the jealousy and hate, but it is still founded on good intentions), and once again because he "wants her"<br />
/n
/n<br />
/n
/nSo this is my interpretation, please comment on it.  i pretty much think its about wanting someone so bad it hurts and brings negative emotions, but no matter what you do you cannot have them.  what do you guys think?   (jeez that took forever to write, and longer to think up!)

/nThe guilty undertaker (sexual revolution)signs that True Love is dead.<br />
/n
/nThe lonesome organ grinder is separated and gets no true love just a coin or two.<br />
/n
/nThe silver saxophones grease the music of bars and hook up scenes. The church bells and the wedding bells are cracked and the washed out horns are no longer triumphantly proclaimin true love.<br />
/n
/n<br />
/n
/nThe poet cannot accept it... it's not that way, I wasnt born into the generation in which true love died.  I want you.. I want true love.<br />
/n
/n<br />
/n
/nDrunken Politician leaps to his suicide in the street. No love for politicians. Mothers weep for children lost to the streets and the revolution. Saviours are sleeping but they would provide True Love. They expect me the poet to open the gate of true love again, but Dylan's cup is broken. He does not have true love and wants it so bad.<br />
/n
/n<br />
/n
/nAll my father's I feel refers to Dylan's poetical influences. The modernist poets disavow true love and embrace science and disdain the romantic poets. The daughter's of the sexual revolution are putting him down because he is romantically proclaiming that he wants True Love. They put him down because they are free, now from "True Love."<br />
/n
/n<br />
/n
/nHe moves down the social ladder to the Queen of Spades, maybe a bar or hotel, the chambermaid, the hotel room maid or the waitress. He is not afraid to look at her to see if she still believe in True Love. She understands and agrees about True Love. She knows that he wants True Love but he does not want it with her.  The Queen of Spades could be a symbol of death. She wants true love but for him it would be death with the chambermaid. So, it does not matter because she is not part of the sexual revolutionaries.<br />
/n
/n<br />
/n
/nDancing child with His suit could be Cupid or Pan with his Pan flute. He is taking away Cupid's flute because he doesn't want just lust or to temporarily be in capricious love.<br />
/n
/nHe took away the flute and wasn't that cute to him. <br />
/n
/n<br />
/n
/nHe took away the lust flute and wants True Love. He wants the real thing.<br />
/n
/n<br />
/n
/nThis is just my humble opinion of what this poem is about.<br />
/n
/nI dont claim to have anything other than my own point of view about this poem.<br />
/n
/nI love this poem and most everything Bob Dylan wrote.  <br />
/n
/n<br />
/n
/nI think of him as a "Great" poet.<br />

/nThe girl he loves is gone, maybe she is death or maybe she refuse the singer.<br />
/n
/n<br />
/n
/nThe world is spoiled, things are happening that don’t happen in a normal world. That’s why you’re not with me now. (first 2 couplets) Because in a normal world, we would be together, we are meant to be together.<br />
/n
/n<br />
/n
/nNobody learnt me how to love, everything I did, I did it wrong to you. (3rd couplet)<br />
/n
/n<br />
/n
/nSo I start gambling, I start drinking because I don’t know what to do. (4rd couplet)<br />
/n
/n<br />
/n
/nI hurt the people/things you like, I’m sorry, but I do it because they toke the time of yours that was meant to spend with me. It’s not fair.<br />
/n
/n<br />
/n
/nDon’t you understand, everything I did, I did it for you, I’m so desperate for you.

/nit's about edie sedgwick (he also wrote leopard-skin pill-box hat and like a rolling stone about her(?) which is kinda debated) and (supposedly) her involvement with warhol and his "scene"<br />
/n
/n<br />
/n
/n"now your dancing child with his Chinese suit<br />
/n
/nHe spoke to me, I took his flute<br />
/n
/nNo, I wasn't very cute to him, was I?<br />
/n
/nBut I did it, though, because he lied<br />
/n
/nBecause he took you for a ride<br />
/n
/nAnd because time was on his side<br />
/n
/nAnd because I<br />
/n
/nWant you"<br />
/n
/n^ is meant to be about him meeting andy.<br />
/n
/nedie wanted him to, but he was hesitant because he knew he wouldn't be liked by andy and edies other friends, but he went anyway although he didnt feign being someone he wasnt to win them over ..<br />

/nAll of the people and images--the guilty undertaker, the dancing child, the cracked bells, the drunken politician-- what is all that about?  They show up for a line or two, or even just half a line, and then that's it.  You don't hear of them again.  But in spite of their short appearances, they still somehow manage to add a lot to the song.  Dylan says a lot about these characters in just a couple of words.  But he also leaves so much out that you can't help but wonder.  There's next to no facts about them, but you intuitively know all about them and what they're like.  Bob Dylan is a mind f***.  And that's just one more reason why he's so great.

/nHere is my spin:<br />
/n
/n <br />
/n
/nA man, a lover lost his wife and refuses the necessary steps to deal with it. True love was lost. <br />
/n
/n<br />
/n
/nThe 'undertaker' sees this and is 'guilty' how he himself reacts to the inevitable monochromatic world of death. <br />
/n
/n<br />
/n
/n'The lonesome organ grinder' is the lover who realizes that he can no longer entertain and delight his lover and has nothing to offer but tears. <br />
/n
/n<br />
/n
/nThe 'silver saxophnes' are the instruments of lovers, and say that you need to move on and stop grieving, yet the lover thought that his love for her was eternal so anything afterward would be 'cracked bells', signifying marriage and any celebration would be nothing more than the sound of 'washed out horns' as if to mock his true love that 'blow into my face with scorn' because it wasn't supposed to be like this.<br />
/n
/n <br />
/n
/nHe can't reconcile that fact that she is now gone because, 'But it's not that way, I wasn't born to lose you.' And so yearns, 'I want you, I want you, honey I want you... so bad'.<br />
/n
/n<br />
/n
/nI'll keep working on the next stanzas.<br />
