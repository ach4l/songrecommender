				<strong class="title">General Comment</strong>Wow, this song has so many literary allusions it is quite a task deciphering what this song is about.  I'm really stumped.  I'd appreciate it if anyone could clue me in to what Bob's talking about.

			This is a great question and I've thought long and hard about what this song is all about.  "Desolation Row" clearly represents some sort of mental state of despair.  Dylan takes a whole bunch of literary and historical characters and puts them in depressing and lonely situations.  He connects them all to this desolate place but doesn't mention his own connection to it until the very end.  Who these characters are and why they all have this connection to "Desolation Row" becomes evident in the last and crucial stanza of the song.<br />
The way I see it, Dylan was in correspondence with someone he used to have a relationship with (probably Sara) and she describes in detail what she was up to in life.  Dylan can't bear to hear all of this and it makes him miserable. He then proceeds to take all of the people she mentioned in her letter feels the need to "rearrange their faces and give them all another name".  And that is really the crux of what the song is all about.  All these ridiculous and exaggerated characters are representations of real people in Dylan's life that he has to send to "Desolation Row".  This is the only way he can comfort himself from the fact that he is really the one on "Desolation Row".  He hates that Sara is doing so well and asks her not to tell him all about her life.  Not unless she sends them from Desolation Row, of course, meaning not unless she too is as miserable as he is.			<div class="sign">

			Reread the lyrics.  Desolation is not a bad place.  It represents reality.  All of the other circus freaks are living in fantasy land, either peaking into DR, or trying to get into DR.  At the end, the narrater says he doesn't want any more letters unless they come from DR, meaning reality.  Stop the BS, stop w/ the fantasy world, get real.  It is a song that tries to make sense of the absurdity of modern life.  While the narrater may feel he is in DR--a bad place, or state of mind--it is far preferable to the candyland existence of the phonies and losers outside its walls.  Still, it is a hallucinatory world that is nearly impossible to figure out, only that Dylan seems disturbed by all of the insaninty and phonieness that inhabits his world.  Like all Dylan's songs, they are usually autobiographically, but there are always multiple meanings as well.  This one is best to just enjoy the imagery, and esp. great guitar work by Charlie McCoy.			<div class="sign">

			You are on the money, railroadgin. I'll only add to your incisive observations that the song is clearly about life itself (reality, as you have pointed out) and the existential predicament we all find ourselves in (a recurring theme, by the way, in a lot of his music, including the Ballad of the Thin Man on the same album). I have listened to Desolation Row, a timeless masterpiece, countless times over the years and consider it not only one of Dylan's best all-around efforts but one of the finest and most satisfying songs in the history of popular music.			<div class="sign">
