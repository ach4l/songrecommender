				<strong class="title">General Comment</strong>I think Dylan is working on three levels -- (1) making fun of an unhip reporter and other straights, (2) describing the gay New York art scene and the nervous challenge of encountering homosexuality, and (3) tricking the people who think they are hip and know what is happening but completely miss the homosexual layer of the song.

				<strong class="title">General Comment</strong>I totally agree with those who think this is a song about an establishment guy, a bit smug about himself, who has found himself at a "happening" a '60s term used by the counter establishment. He is confronted by "Freaks", another '60s term. And, I'm not sure about this part, but for some reason i have always thought that "made to wear earphones" was a reference to Vonnegut's "Harrison Bergeron", just in the sense that he should wear headphones with continual static so he won't be able to think, and thus be bothered by the times that were A'changing.

				<strong class="title">General Comment</strong>Mr. Jones is a homosexual, but the song is about people that are lost, people that don't know what they want. <br />
Because as you can see, Mr. Jones is a man that has everything, but he is not actually happy because he doesnt know what he wants, that is why he goes to a gay club. But the main point of the song is not to describe homosexually, but to decribe how does it feel to be out of place looking for your place.

				<strong class="title">General Comment</strong>So When Mr Jones says, these are the meanings, these are the contacts, this is what they mean, That comes out like a one eyed midget saying NOW.<br />
<br />
Mr Jones preforms miracles, but it leads people to follow pagan beliefs. This what How Now Brown Cow means.<br />
<br />
The Camel hold water. Telling people what these contacts mean, these song lyrics is like turning wine into water for the purpose of getting sending people into a knowledge of Heaven. The camel symbolizes trying to get these people to believe.<br />
<br />
Expressing this is putting the point of view into himself eyese in his pocket. His own identy in his state, Nose(pride) to the ground, (real place here) <br />
<br />
There aught to be a law against This guy priding himself. <br />
<br />
Next time you do, remember first, to telephone.<br />
or<br />
He should wear earphones, Should hear of his own coming around. as he see himself coming around, sees himself, smells himself.) It seems so self important, but he's doing it forhimself. And he's not in good shape either. He's the Geek after all.

				<strong class="title">General Comment</strong>You walk into the room (viewing room)<br />
With your pencil in your hand<br />
(you want to write all you criticisms about this naked guy)<br />

You see somebody naked <br />
<br />
<br />
And you say, "Who is that man?"<br />
You try so hard<br />
But you don't understand<br />
Just what you'll say<br />
When you get home <br />
(can't judge the guy without hypocrisy)<br />
<br />
Because something is happening here<br />
But you don't know what it is<br />
Do you, Mister Jones<br />
(the narrator is talking to Mr Jones, almost as a shock) <br />
<br />
You raise up your head<br />
And you ask, "Is this where it is?"<br />
<br />
And somebody points to you and says<br />
"It's his"<br />
And you say, "What's mine?"<br />
And somebody else says, "Where what is?"<br />
And you say, "Oh my God<br />
Am I here all alone?"<br />

<br />
Because something is happening here<br />

Do you, Mister Jones<br />
<br />
You hand in your ticket<br />
<br />
(a persons life.)<br />
<br />
And you go watch the geek<br />
(to see Mr Jones, The everyone the All.) <br />
<br />
Who immediately walks up to you<br />
When he hears you speak <br />
<br />
(mr Jones reacting to to the criticms.)<br />
And says, "How does it feel<br />
To be such a freak?"<br />
(how does it feel to be Mr Jones the All and Mr Jones.)<br />
<br />
And you say, "Impossible"<br />
(mr Jones says, it feels impossible)<br />
<br />
As he hands you a bone<br />
(give the dog a bone, the Geek, hands Mr jones a bone which is shameful small and needed.) <br />
Because something is happening here<br />
But you don't know what it is<br />
Do you, Mister Jones<br />
<br />
You have many contacts<br />
Among the lumberjacks<br />
(mr jones has contacts:When all of your advisers heave their plastic<br />
At your feet to convince you of your pain)<br />
To get you facts<br />
When somebody attacks your imagination<br />
(He can read between the lines.)<br />
But nobody has any respect<br />
Anyway they already expect you<br />
To just give a check<br />
To tax-deductible charity organizations<br />
(they do not respect Mr Jones, they would expect this guy to write a check to tax deductable organizations if he was anything special.)<br />
<br />
You've been with the professors<br />
And they've all liked your looks<br />
With great lawyers you have<br />
Discussed lepers and crooks<br />
You've been through all of<br />
F. Scott Fitzgerald's books<br />
You're very well read<br />
It's well known<br />

(Wise in understanding the nature of man and life.)<br />
<br />
Because something is happening here<br />
But you don't know what it is<br />
Do you, Mister Jones<br />
Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you<br />
And then he kneels<br />
(this is the messiah, he has the burdens of the world, sword swallower.)<br />
<br />
He crosses himself<br />
And then he clicks his high heels<br />
(He has high heels because he had conquered sin and was given a high seat.)<br />
<br />
And without further notice<br />
He asks you how it feels<br />
<br />
(Bob's telling Mr jones something here..)<br />
And he says, "Here is your throat back<br />
Thanks for the loan"<br />
(he's saying that mr jones was the same as one who conquered. Though mr jones is in a shameful caricature.)He could be dead, He could be not<br />
He could be You<br />
He's Camelian, Comedian, Corinthian and Caricature<br />
"Shooting-up Pie-in-the-Sky"<br />
<br />
Because something is happening here<br />
But you don't know what it is<br />
Do you, Mister Jones<br />
Now you see this one-eyed midget<br />
<br />
(small minded undivine view.)<br />
Shouting the word "NOW"<br />
And you say, "For what reason?"<br />
And he says, "How?"<br />
(pagan, how said tonto, how now brown cow)<br />
And you say, "What does this mean?"<br />
And he screams back, "You're a cow<br />
(a false idol, golden calf)<br />
Give me some milk<br />
(people who see Mr jones wants some miricles or for him to shut up.)<br />
Or else go home"<br />

"Song For Bob Dylan"<br />
<br />
Oh, hear this Robert Zimmerman<br />
I wrote a song for you<br />
About a strange young man<br />
called Dylan<br />
With a voice like sand and glue<br />
His words of truthful vengeance<br />
They could pin us to the floor<br />
Brought a few more people on<br />
And put the fear in a whole lot more<br />
<br />
Ah, Here she comes<br />
Here she comes<br />
Here she comes again<br />
The same old painted lady<br />
From the brow of a superbrain<br />
She'll scratch this world to pieces<br />
As she comes on like a friend<br />
But a couple of songs<br />
From your old scrapbook<br />
Could send her home again<br />
<br />
You gave your heart to every bedsit room<br />
At least a picture on my wall<br />
And you sat behind a million pair of eyes<br />
And told them how they saw<br />
Then we lost your train of thought<br />
The paintings are all your own<br />
While troubles are rising<br />
We'd rather be scared<br />
Together than alone<br />
<br />
Ah, Here she comes...[etc.]<br />
<br />
Now hear this Robert Zimmerman<br />
Though I don't suppose we'll meet<br />
Ask your good friend Dylan<br />
If he'd gaze a while<br />
down the old street<br />
Tell him we've lost his poems<br />
So they're writing on the walls<br />
Give us back our unity<br />
Give us back our family<br />
You're every nation's refugee<br />
Don't leave us with their sanity<br />
<br />
Ah, Here she comes....[etc.] <br />
<br />
<br />
BOB DYLAN BLUES<br />
(Written by Syd Barrett)<br />
Syd Barrett<br />
<br />
<br />
Got the Bob Dylan blues <br />
And the Bob Dylan Shoes <br />
And my clothes and my hairâs in a mess <br />
But you know I just couldnât care less <br />
<br />
Goinâ to write me a song <br />
Boutâ whatâs right and whatâs wrong <br />
Boutâ god and my girl and all that <br />
Quiet while I make like a cat <br />
<br />
Chorus: <br />
Cause Iâm a poet <br />
Donât ya know it <br />
And the wind, you can blow it <br />
Cause Iâm Mr. Dylan, the king <br />
And Iâm free as a bird on the wing <br />
<br />
Roam from town to town <br />
Guess I get people down <br />
But I donât care too much about that <br />
Cause my gut and my wallet are fat <br />
<br />
Make a whole lotta dough <br />
But I deserve it though <br />
Iâve got soul and a good heart of gold <br />
So Iâll sing about war in the cold <br />
<br />
Chorus (see above): <br />
<br />
Well I sing about dreams <br />
And I rhymes it with seams <br />
Cause it seems that my dream always means <br />
That I can prophesy all kinds of things <br />
<br />
Well the guy that digs me <br />
Should try hard to see <br />
That he buys all my discs in a hat <br />
And when Iâm in town go see that <br />
<br />
Chorus (see above): <br />
<br />
Dylan Mr Jones and Queen Jane. One dude.

				<strong class="title">My Interpretation</strong>I think it's about an educated, highly intelligent, well-known banker and a good man who's risen to the top of the corporate food chain. <br />
<br />
"You walk into the room<br />
With your pencil in your hand<br />
You see somebody naked<br />
And you say, "Who is that man?"<br />
You try so hard<br />
But you don't understand<br />
Just what you'll say<br />
When you get home"<br />
<br />
As so equolently stated previously, it makes logical sense that the man's wife is cheating on him and he walked in during sex. Businessmen are often away from home for long periods of time, leaving the wives that married them for money plenty of time to hook up with other men. Mr. Jones, being an intelligent man, begins to notice the signs of unfaithfulness and decides that, rather than live in ignorance, he'll discover and confront the truth. He finds his wife and, heartbroken, leaves.<br />
<br />
"You raise up your head<br />
And you ask, "Is this where it is?"<br />
And somebody points to you and says<br />
"It's his"<br />
And you say, "What's mine?"<br />
And somebody else says, "Where what is?"<br />
And you say, "Oh my God<br />
Am I here all alone?""<br />
<br />
Mr. Jones is walking around the city, looking for a friend of his who works now at a carnival, looking for some advice. His head is down, his hands are in his pockets; he's moping. As he walks, he begins to hear lots of people talking. He looks up, sees a big crowd trying to get into the park where it seems a circus is visiting and asks someone "Is this where it is?" referring to the circus. One of the crowd points and whispers to his friend that "it's his", referring to the land. Mr. Jones is dressed in a suit and tie, having had no chance to redress himself as he walked out of his house. The man in the crowd is making a joke that Mr. Jones owns the property. Mr. Jones asks "what's mine?" angrily, not happy at being stereotyped. Somebody answers his first question with "where what is?" and Mr. Jones has a mini-breakdown. It seems like everyone is either against him or an idiot.<br />
<br />
"You hand in your ticket<br />
And you go watch the geek<br />
Who immediately walks up to you<br />
When he hears you speak<br />
And says, "How does it feel<br />
To be such a freak?"<br />
And you say, "Impossible"<br />
As he hands you a bone"<br />
<br />
Mr. Jones goes to visit an old friend of his from college who's working at a dead-end job. His friend was a good guy and a smart guy, but for one reason or another his life, like Mr. Jones', collapsed and he's now working in some kind of circus. When he hears Mr. Jones speak as an intellectual, he asks, "how does it feel to be such a freak?" The 'hands you a bone' line may refer to him giving Mr. Jones help of some kind, perhaps a place to stay the night as he sorts through what he'll do with his wife and career.<br />
<br />
"You have many contacts<br />
Among the lumberjacks<br />
To get you facts<br />
When somebody attacks your imagination"<br />
<br />
He knows the 'commoners' on a work basis. He understands how the average man works and operates, because he's a genius, but he only speaks and interacts with them to prove his theories which he knows to be true (when somebody attacks his 'imagination').<br />
<br />
"But nobody has any respect<br />
Anyway they already expect you<br />
To just give a check<br />
To tax-deductible charity organizations<br />
You've been with the professors<br />
And they've all liked your looks<br />
With great lawyers you have<br />
Discussed lepers and crooks<br />
You've been through all of<br />
F. Scott Fitzgerald's books<br />
You're very well read<br />
It's well known"<br />
<br />
Dylan takes a break here to explain what's going on to our friend Mr. Jones. No one respects him because of his intellect and money. They assume he's just another crooked businessman, out to rip off the peons working below him. They expect and demand he 'give back to the community', so to speak, though nobody cares about him. They just all want their check.<br />
<br />
"Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you<br />
And then he kneels<br />
He crosses himself<br />
And then he clicks his high heels<br />
And without further notice<br />
He asks you how it feels<br />
And he says, "Here is your throat back<br />
Thanks for the loan""<br />
<br />
The sword swallower at the circus Mr. Jones' friend works at is bitter. He sees Mr. Jones in his suit and tie, approaches, and kneels, crossing himself like one would before a priest, sarcastically offering reverence to the 'American success story' Mr. Jones. He asks how it feels to be out of luck, then says "here is your throat back - thanks for the loan", referring caustically to Mr. Jones' profession, saying that he deserved to be the one working a dead-end circus job.<br />
<br />
"Now you see this one-eyed midget<br />
Shouting the word "NOW"<br />
And you say, "For what reason?"<br />
And he says, "How?"<br />
And you say, "What does this mean?"<br />
And he screams back, "You're a cow<br />
Give me some milk<br />
Or else go home""<br />
<br />
The midget is screaming that someone should compensate for the weaknesses he was born with--NOW! Mr. Jones says "For what reason?" but, once again, Mr. Jones finds it hard to communicate. The midget answers "how?" The midget sees the issue as self-explanatory, and concludes that Mr. Jones is asking how to help. In response, Mr. Jones says "What does this mean?" He doesn't understand the logic behind the midget's reasoning. The midget begins to understand the situation and screams "you're a cow! Give me some milk or else go home!" He sees Mr. Jones as nothing more than an oppressor and demands the compensation from him. <br />
<br />
"Well, you walk into the room<br />
Like a camel and then you frown<br />
You put your eyes in your pocket<br />
And your nose to the ground<br />
There ought to be a law<br />
Against you comin' around<br />
You should be made<br />
To wear earphones"<br />
<br />
Mr. Jones decides it's better to live in ignorance with his unfaithful wife than to be alone in a world of those who hate him. He walks back into his house 'like a camel', plodding forward after a long and terrible journey. He 'puts his eyes in his pocket' (ignoring the world around him and the truth) and his 'nose to the ground' (allowing his wife to walk all over him). 'There ought to be a law against you comin' around' is the stance of those who hate him; he 'should be made to wear earphones', to not be able to understand the world, to be like everyone else.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Because something is happening here<br />
But you don't know what it is...<br />
