				<strong class="title">General Comment</strong>I actually think this song is about the Holocaust because:<br />
<br />
Mama, take this badge off of me<br />
I can't use it anymore.<br />
It's gettin' dark, too dark for me to see<br />
I feel like I'm knockin' on heaven's door.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I think the badge Bob Dylan speaks of is the star of David, Which Jews were made to wear during the Holocaust. When he says he dosent need the badge anymore is because he is about to walk in to a gas chamber or maybe in to a cremation chamber. Bob Dylan's real name is Robert Allen Zimmerman he was born jewish changed his name because he never felt like Judaism was for him, but later became Christian.<br />
<br />
Mama, put my guns in the ground<br />
I can't shoot them anymore.<br />
That long black cloud is comin' down<br />
I feel like I'm knockin' on heaven's door.<br />
<br />
<br />
In this verse I think hes talking about how when the Jews were put in to the ghettos then deported to the concentration camps many jews buried there belongings because they were only aloud to bring food and clothes. Many Nazi ordered them to give up there gold jewelry and other valuables.<br />

				<strong class="title">My Interpretation</strong>The song is from the movie Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid, where Garrett a sheriff was rumoured to be an old friend of the gangster Billy the Kid. Garrett had to make a tough decision to choose his duty over his friendship. The song may perhaps had arosed in his heart at the moment when he had to shoot down his buddy. <br />
<br />
"Mama take this batch off me" <br />
"I can't use it anymore". <br />
by this lines Pat Garrett means he does'nt wanna be sheriff anymore if it's means to kill your friend for the sake of duty.<br />
<br />
"It's getting dark too dark to see" <br />
Feel like I m knocking on heaven's door". <br />
here Garrett is trying to denote that the conception of the good and the bad is getting hazy and unclear....and due to dis he's unable to conclude on which side he is or what he's doing is the right thing or not? As a result it seems he's been denied salvation and an entry into heaven for all the sins he's committed...dat's why he feels like knocking on heaven's door and waiting to be permitted in......... <br />
<br />
"Mama put my guns in the ground" <br />
"I can't shoot them anymore"............ <br />
Garrett is seen here asking his mama(mother) to put his gun,his weapon of destruction,harmlessly in the ground because he doesn't want to take anymore lives. <br />
<br />
<br />
"That long black cloud is coming down" <br />
"I feel like I m knocking on heaven's door" <br />
here the long black cloud may have been regarded by Garrett as the elements from the heaven which is keeping a record of all the sins he is doing and it's coming down to question him about his deeds.Still, he's standing outside heaven's door,knocking and begging to be let in.<br />
<br />
The song simply deals with the concept of blindfolded thinking and the conflict within oneself when the person's conscience rises to question him about the justification of his actions make him realize the true meaning of his deeds. <br />
<br />

By putting his guns and badge in the ground he doesn't want other people to make the same mistakes he has. Thats just what I think no facts to back it up.

				<strong class="title">General Comment</strong>Dont trouble yourself, kids.   He and most other amazing vision song wirters write from deep within themselves.  They wirte with feeling, passion, and their own experiences, self expression, social commentary, philosophy.....and just away to retaliate and make a statement.      <br />
We may understand, appreciate and associate these songs with our own lives, but not one person besides the song writer himself will trully know the depth and heart that went into the song.  He has his own meaning with simplicity so it can be read and understood by anyone willing to listen, but we can not completely and trully deocode his mind or even the song itself.  We all will find our own meaning and defination in each song....thats the point...to make you think...to make you see.<br />
Listen to the song and find what it means to you. Dont trouble yourself of figruing out what this genius ment it to be.  <br />
"is he folk, is he blue's, is he rock, is he anti war, what is he trying to say?"  Remember, he and many other song writers are not....or should not be defined by what they do....but who they are.    Bob Dylan made folk music, country music, blues music, anti war music.....yes. But that is NOT what defines him.  He is not a folk singer, not an anti war lyricist.  He is not a labeled individual (or should not be).  <br />
Bob Dylan is a deep minded, intellegent, intellectual, visonary.  He can see things, and comprehend things that most people are too brainwashed or blinded to see.  <br />
<br />
But personally, This song really hits me hard. My lover is in the airforce.   This song makes me think about how the military and government can completely scar the possiblities of a happy, free life.<br />
Many soldiers only join "to be heros", or for free health care, free college, an easy income...(by that i mean its an easy way to finally make ends meet, and to finally make something of your career) These are the people that after serving for awhile realize how corrupt our government is and how brainwashed they have become to be. They learn that this is not their lives, and this is not how they would have choosen there lives to be.  But at this point, stuck and lost. The choice is scrape by everyday at a hardworking job, barey making ends meet....or easy paychecks while being puppets of the government.    Its not until its too late that they realize this, and its not easy knowing you're killing innocent people for someone elses greed, power and lies. You're life is dictated and pretty much over at this point....it feels like theres really no point in going on.     <br />
<br />
I see these people engineered like machines constantly....Its the most painful thing someone could experince.   So this song really hits me hard,... it shows the same pain that i feel, and many (not all)  soldiers feel....and so many other puppets of this corrupt gov/corp world feel.

				<strong class="title">General Comment</strong>HEY OAF, i have message for you:<br />
<br />
Knockin' on Heaven's Door" is a song written and performed by Bob Dylan for the soundtrack of the 1973 film Pat Garrett & Billy the Kid.    It was infact NOT Jerry Garcia who wrote or made this song.    Dylan's is the original.   Eric clapton, bob marley, GNR, and according to you: jerry garcia as well made covers of this song. (I'll have to research that one though. )<br />
<br />
But, man, get your facts straight.     This is one of the most amazing Dylan originals.
