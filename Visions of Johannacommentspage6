				<strong class="title">General Comment</strong>I thought about this song a lot, as most people believe it was written about his breakup with Joan Baez.  the light went off for me when i read that Dylan told Pennebaker to edit most of Joan Baez out of "Don't look Back."  He said: <br />
"There's too much Joan in it."  It seems that he wrote the song while watching all the footage from that tour.  if you see the new edition of the film, you'll catch a lot of the imagery.

				<strong class="title">General Comment</strong>like meepow - wonderfully entertaining discussion - and like meepow I'm sure Dylan is acting like any artist - collecting - then rearranging. <br />
<br />
Like any great artist his strength is reporting on the age in which he lives.<br />
<br />
The closest to understanding the "construction" of songs like "Johanna" and "Sad eyed Lady of the Lowlands" might be to consider the art of the montage photographer!<br />
For years the photographer "collects" images (I use photography for personal reasons and because by necessity it's peculiarly contemporary), then when the muse is active those "takes" on reality through life experience, are melded together ,with colours, lines and smudges into a "picture", "poem", "song" - or work of art.<br />

				<strong class="title">General Comment</strong>I love the discussion!  Great stuff.<br />
I remember several years ago, I would sit for hours and listen to Dylan's music, feeling it, absorbing it.  I can see the validity of the many interpretations listed here (the WWII one being quite a stretch, but anyhow), and I would like to share mine.  The imagery is very powerful in this song, as in many of his songs.  He is essentially a painter of words.  With many of his songs, it's about the many layers.  If you get down and into the words/poetry you will find many meanings, a lot of times because things are ambiguous and such.  However, on a different level, a visual level, you see a different 'picture'.  If you lay back and take your brain out of it a little bit, you can 'see'.  Each line is a brush stroke, each verse a piece of the puzzle, coming together to form a mental image.  I remember reading something that he said from an interview when asked how he wrote songs.  He said (paraphrasing) that it was like taking pictures of things at different times and/or different places and putting them all together on one canvas.  They appear that they all belong together at once, but really were pieced together to form a whole new, independent picture.  A car seen in the picture may have been parked in front of the same building in the picture, but the car was parked there last year, or last summer during the day, when the building was pictured in the winter at night, etc, etc.  To me that makes perfect sense.  Explaining it to everyone seems more difficult.  <br />
<br />
I always loved the many characters in Dylan's songs.  They may be almost comic or cartoony or fantastical exaggerations, but that is the beauty of it.  <br />
<br />
I see the song as almost a dream sequence.  He is in bed with Louise, but he dreams of Johanna (the pined for perfection of something that you will never have, and feeling sorry for yourself because you can't have the unattainable).  Striving for perfection, but never getting there.  Some might compare this thought to how some view religious belief systems (God is perfect, be like Him, of course you can't but try anyway because that is what good people do throughout their lives).  He is beating himself up about not being perfect, and being ashamed of thinking that he should be beating himself up over it.  <br />
<br />
     Inside the museums, Infinity goes up on trial<br />
     Voices echo this is what salvation must be like after a while<br />
<br />
I love that line, as I am sure a lot of you do.  The imagery that this brings up is priceless.  You could look at this line and interpret that maybe eternal oblivion, or heaven or whatever, in a form where you are somehow conscious of 'being' and living out forever, trying to find something to do.  Eventually, 'infinity' itself would be debated, just to have something to do.  In a museum, all of the pictures and sculptures and photos are there for you to look at and as a society pick which ones should be kept and which ones are now chosen not to be worthy.  We judge the past, present and future based upon what little we know at the moment.  There is no one 'infinity' because within each finite space and time are infinite possibilities.  I digress.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, Dylan was also taking lots of drugs and/or not sleeping very much at the time, his brain cells must have been firing like a trillion bats out of hell.  He probably cannot fully grasp the entirety of this 'vision'.  And so therein lies the full beauty of this wonderful piece of work.

				<strong class="title">General Comment</strong>Stanza 1 - Dylan plays with pronouns.  He wants this song to be more than just about him and a relationship, but more about the human relationship and a feeling of detachment with the world.  The world around him hits him hard with a reality he doesn't want to face, not playing into his ideal.  He feels trapped by things around him, Louise, the music, the room, sounds, etc. and he's looking out the windown into the endless night (infinity) wondering what more it has to offer.  He contrasts what he wants with what he has, and it leaves him unsatisfied, disconnected, and living inside his head... an ode to the act of writing a song (where he has control of reality).<br />
<br />
Stanza 2 - The image moves outside of his prison to the street, where he sees the universality of what he is talking about.  He introduces more empty images of love with the all-night girls and men who can't see and talking of insanity, which is a literal disconnect from reality.  He talks of emptiness in the discussion of the mirror and himself reflecting in her, and the ghost of electricity shows further emptiness in Louise and his feelings for her.  His mind takes him out of reality towards Johanna.<br />
<br />
Stanza 3- This is a stanza that all men can relate to.  Men feel vulnerable with women and getting hurt, longing for a past lovve.  The effect of this vulnerability is a recess into indealist images, to keep from feelnign sadness<br />
<br />
Stanza 4- The museum is all of his experiences and accomplishments.  And Dylan shows how an infinity of good times and accomplishments can be tainted and devalued by loss of love.  Love is blind and can be the source of obsession and a tunnel vision, where someone can forget everything else that matters.<br />
<br />
Stanza 5 - It speaks of deceiving people, those who try to get everything they can from someone with a facade of kindness.  Nothing is really as it seems.  Dylan calls for Madonna to come and save the world, but she doesn't come.  He chooses to return to his idealist vision of the one he loves, obsessively, forgetting about all the trivial things around him.<br />
<br />
This song is about longing for an ideal, escaping the triviality of the world, looking for more in the abyss of the future and the past, rather than focusing on the present, because it is disappointing.

				<strong class="title">General Comment</strong>i love this song coz my name's johanna and up until i found this song i never really liked my name... from now on though i shall love it! how many girls would love to be 'johanna' in this song.... she's like, in my opinion, who we all wanna be... like, even if we've lost that love we're still on that person's mind all the time and no one else compares to us... even if losing them makes you unhappy (and it would be way better if you were still with them) having someone out there who feels that way about you is awesome... i agree with what quite a few people have said here, that johanna is who he truly loves, can't forget and will die loving while louise is just, you know, someone to warm the bed... god i love my name now lol..

				<strong class="title">General Comment</strong>I agree that this song is about being with a girl who you dont love. "nothing to turn off" means he can't turn it off because it wasn't turned on to begin with. <br />
<br />
This girl Joanna is the one he actually loves. I guess its the idea of her now she has gone off with the "little boy lost" I get the impression that it's actually the memory of her he loves. You know absense makes the heart grow fonder.

				<strong class="title">General Comment</strong>Just an idea... the section about the women in the museum a possible reference to TS Eliot's 'Love Song of J Alfred Prufrock'....." in the room the women come and go talking of michelangelo". In that poem these women are fake and force this talk to appear intelligent or to create an image of themselves being high-minded and clever- something they're not. In this song Dylan wants what he can't have but ultimately accepts he has to live with this just as Prufrock(in the poem) has to live with these women in a world where he isn't really comfortable or satisfied.<br />
<br />
In the song there is a mysterious atmosphere: he sees visions of this mystical and unreachable johanna and he's obsessed with her just as Prufrock is tormented by the question he wants to ask. So, in both, there is a sense of never being able to get quite what we want despite our obsession. Prufrock is also a balding, lonely, desperate, middle-aged man and there is an obvious sense of desperation about Dylan here too. I think the central characters are very similar in both.<br />
<br />
I'm not suggesting the whole poem is just an elaborate reference to TS Eliot, it's much much more than that but there are a few other lines that could be seen to fit in with Prufrock "takes himself so seriously..brags of his misery" and "night watchman" could be like the "eternal footman" in 'Prufrock'.<br />
<br />
Probably stretching it a bit but with some of the other crackpot theories on display I thought I'd get my 2 cents in.
